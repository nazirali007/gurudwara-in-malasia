                  The hair will be worn unshorn and tied in a knot to keep them manageable. 
                  Guru Nanak Sahib in Aasa di Vaar had already said that loose hair are like the dust that blinds one's eyes.
                  Guru Gobind Singh Ji also commanded his Sikhs to observe that hair should be kept clean and washed regularly. 
                  Matted hair were not allowed and accepted in his presence. Males should also take care of their beards and keep 
                  them clean as with the hair on the head. The beard of the male should not be touched by the scissors or the knife to shorten them.</p>
                <p className="text2 text-start pt-1 m-2">It is worth noting that while men were expected to cut hair women were meant to keep 
                  their hair long to define their femininity. There is still an expectation in society that we are almost 
                  forced to comment on a woman's hair style as offering some insight into her being.
                </p>
                <p className="text2 text-start pt-1 m-2">In asking men and women to respect hair and look 
                  after them Guru Sahib also implicitly expected that men will not 
                  disown that part of their personality that was about nurturing, caring, empathy and gentleness.</p>

                <p className="text2 text-start  m-2">Kanga was to be the instrument of cleansing. A Sikh should wear 
the Kanga in his/ her hair and regularly comb his/ her hair to keep them clean and tidy.
 He will also use the Kanga to clean his beard. Kanga should be simple and 
right for the purpose. It should not be ornamental and worn as a piece of jewellery.
 The Kanga in his hair/ her hair will remind the Sikh that just as the hair need cleansing
 his/ her mind also should be cleansed through the comb of Simran. Health in its general sense
 was very important. The message from Guru Sahib was for the Sikh to be aware that cleansing was 
not just about the hair but also about the mind and one's thoughts and ideas. As one combed the hair
 one should become aware of those ideas and thoughts that separate us from the 'other'. The mind and 
its contents also need a comb. The form of that comb is Simran.

                Kanga teaches the Sikh to bear frustration and accept that effort is
            required for each and every endeavour. Achievements do not come through magic or miracles but through persistence and commitment.

The Kachera has a drawstring that is pulled tight around the waist to ensure that it does not fall down and expose the wearer to ridicule. The length and cover it provided to the Khalsa meant that he could dispose of garments that caused hindrance in battle.</p>

                <p className="text2 text-start  m-2">Historically the poor and the wretched had little by way of garments that were meant to offer them protection from the elements. This was since their status in life was such that they were resigned to the idea that they had nothing to protect. Guru Sahib commenting on the status of the Sikhs had said," My Sikhs are not downtrodden but equal of all". In putting this forward he was also making it clear that they had dignity, respect and rights as equals.</p>

                <p className="text2 text-start  m-2">The knot in the draw string puts emphasis on the wearer that they had personal responsibility for their desires and impulses. They could not put their failings onto others for their conduct.</p>

                <p className="text2 text-start  m-2">Guru Sahiban proffered the Kara to the Khalsa in recognition that in the detail of daily life it is easy to miss the big picture. One can easily succumb to a ritualised way of seeing Waheguru as residing in a designated place or direction. A Gurdwara can become the place of residence of the Guru contrary to the teachings of Guru Sahiban. The phrase "Guru Ang Sang Hai" carries specific potency and urgency. The wearing of the Kara reminds the Khalsa that the Guru does indeed reside in His creation and not in building of bricks and mortar. The Kara worn on the hand that one uses most introduces the Khalsa to the notions of reflexivity, omniscience and omnipotent of Waheguru. Guru is to be found through the Sangat. Indeed Waheguru resides in one's mind since each one of us belongs to Waheguru. The 'other' I see is that aspect of me that I can't come to terms with without seeing them outside of me.</p>
