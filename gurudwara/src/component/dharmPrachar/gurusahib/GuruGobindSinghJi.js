                  The tenth and the last Guru or Prophet-teacher of the Sikh
                  faith, was born Gobind Rai Sodhi on Poh Sudi 7th, 23rd Poh
                  1723 Bikrami Samvat (22 December 1666) at Patna, in Bihar. His
                  father, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the Ninth Guru, was then
                  travelling across Bengal and Assam. Returning to Patna in
                  1670, he directed his family to return to the Punjab. On the
                  site of the house at Patna in which Gobind Rai was born and
                  where he spent his early childhood now stands a sacred shrine,
                  Takht Sri Harmandir Sahib, one of the five most honoured seats
                  of religious authority (takht, lit. throne) for the Sikhs.
                  Gobind Rai was escorted to Anandpur (then known as Chakk
                  Nanaki) at the foothills of the Siwaliks where he reached in
                  March 1672 and there his early education included reading and
                  writing of Punjabi, Braj, Sanskrit and Persian languages. He
                  was barely nine years of age when a sudden turn came in his
                  life as well as in the life of entire Sikh community, he was
                  destined to lead. Early in 1675, a group Kashmiri Brahmans,
                  driven to desperation by the religious fanaticism of the
                  Mughal General Iftikar Khan, visited Anandpur to seek Sri Guru
                  Tegh Bahadur Ji’s intercession. As the Guru sat reflecting
                  what to do, young Gobind Rai, arriving there in company with
                  his playmates, asked “Why he looked so preoccupied”. The
                  father, as records Koer Singh in his Gurbilas Patshahi 10,
                  replied, “Grave are the burdens the earth bears. She will be
                  redeemed only if a truly worthy person comes forward to lay
                  down his head. Distress will then be expunged and happiness
                  ushered in.” “None could be worthier than yourself to make
                  such a sacrifice,” remarked Gobind Rai in his innocent manner.
                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji soon afterwards proceeded to the
                  imperial capital, Delhi, and courted death on 11 November
                  1675. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji was formally installed Guru on
                  Maghar Sudi 5th (11 Maghar), 1732 Samvat (11th Nov, 1675). In
                  the midst of his engagement with the concerns of the
                  community, he gave attention to the mastery of physical skills
                  and literary accomplishment. He had grown into a energetic
                  youth. He had a natural genius for poetic composition and his
                  early years were assiduously given to this pursuit. The Vaar
                  Sri Bhagauti Ji Ki, popularly called Chandi di Var. written in
                  1684, was his first composition. The poem depicted the
                  legendary contest between the gods and the demons as described
                  in the Markandeya Purana . The choice of a warlike theme for
                  this and a number of his later compositions such as the two
                  Chandi Charitar, mostly in Braj, was made to infuse martial
                  spirit among his followers to prepare them to stand up against
                  injustice and tyranny.

                <p className="text1">
                  Much of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji’s creative literary work was
                  done at Paonta, he had founded on the banks of the River
                  Yamuna and to which site he had temporarily shifted in April
                  1685. Poetry as such was, however, not his aim. For him it was
                  a means of revealing the divine principle and concretizing a
                  personal vision of the Supreme Being that had been vouchsafed
                  to him. His Japu and the composition known as Akal Ustati are
                  in this tenor. Through his poetry he preached love and
                  equality and a strictly ethical and moral code of conduct. He
                  preached the worship of the One Supreme Being, deprecating
                  idolatry and superstitious beliefs and observances. The
                  glorification of the sword itself which he eulogized as
                  Bhaguati was to secure fulfilment of God’s justice. The sword
                  was never meant as a symbol of aggression, and it was never to
                  be used for self-aggrandizement. It was the emblem of
                  manliness and self-respect and was to be used only in
                  self-defence, as a last resort. For Sri

                <p className="text1">
                  Guru Gobind Singh Ji said in a Persian couplet in his
                  Zafarnama:
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  When all other means have failed, It is but lawful to take to

                <p className="text1">
                  During his stay at Paonta, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji availed
                  himself of his spare time to practise different forms of manly
                  exercises, such as riding, swimming and archery. His
                  increasing influence among the people and the martial
                  exercises of his men excited the jealousy of the neighbouring
                  Rajput hill rulers who led by Raja Fateh Chand of Garhwal
                  collected a host to attack him. But they were worsted in an
                  action at Bhangani, about 10 km northeast of Paonta, on 18
                  Assu 1745 sk/18 September 1688. Soon thereafter Sri Guru
                  Gobind Singh Ji left Paonta and returned to Anandpur which he
                  fortified in view of the continuing hostility of the Rajput
                  chiefs as well as of the repressive policy of the imperial
                  government at Delhi. The Guru and his Sikhs were involved in a
                  battle with a Mughal commander, Alif Khan, at Nadaun on the
                  left bank of the Beas, about 30 km southeast of Kangra, on 22
                  Chet 1747 Bk/20 March 1691. Describing the battle in stirring
                  verse in Bachitra Natak, he said that Alif Khan fled in utter
                  disarray “without being able to give any attention to his
                  camp.” Among several other skirmishes that occurred was the
                  Hussain battle (20 February 1696) fought against Husain Khan,
                  an imperial general, which resulted in a decisive victory for
                  the Sikhs. Following the appointment in 1694 of the liberal
                  Prince Muazzam (later Emperor Bahadur Shah) as viceroy of
                  northwestern region including Punjab, there was however a
                  brief respite from pressure from the ruling authority.

                <p className="text1">
                  In 1698, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji issued directions to Sikh
                  sangats or communities in different parts of India not to
                  acknowledge masands, the local ministers, against whom he had
                  heard complaints. Sikhs, he instructed, should come to
                  Anandpur straight without any intermediaries and bring their
                  offerings personally. The Guru thus established direct
                  relationship with his Sikhs and addressed them as his Khalsa,
                  Persian term used for crown-lands as distinguished from feudal
                  chiefs. The institution of the Khalsa was given concrete form
                  on 30 March 1699 when Sikhs had gathered at Anandpur in large
                  numbers for the annual festival of Baisakhi. Sri Guru Gobind
                  Singh Ji appeared before the assembly dramatically on that day
                  with a naked sword in hand and, to quote Koer Singh, Gurbilas
                  Patshahi 10, spoke: “Is there present a true Sikh who would
                  offer his head to the Guru as a sacrifice?” The words numbed
                  the audience who looked on in awed silence. The Guru repeated
                  the call. At the third call Daya Ram, a Sobti Khatri of
                  Lahore, arose and humbly walked behind the Guru to a tent near
                  by. The Guru returned with his sword dripping blood, and asked
                  for another head. At this Daram Das, a Jatt from Hastinapur,
                  came forward and was taken inside the enclosure. Sri Guru
                  Gobind Singh Ji made three more calls. Muhkam Chand, a
                  washerman from Dvarka, Himmat, a water-carrier from
                  Jagannathpur, and Sahib Chand, a barber from Bidar (Karnataka)
                  responded one after another and advanced to offer their heads.
                  All the five were led back from the tent dressed alike in
                  saffron-coloured raiment topped over with neatly tied turbans
                  similarly dyed, with swords dangling by their sides. Sri Guru
                  Gobind Singh Ji then introduced Khande Di Pahul, i.e.
                  initiation by sweetened water churned with a double-edged
                  broadsword (khanda). Those five Sikhs were the first to be
                  initiated. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji called them Panj Pyare,
                  the five devoted spirits beloved of the Guru. These five,
                  formed the nucleus of the self-abnegating, martial and
                  casteless fellowship of the Khalsa. All of them surnamed
                  Singh, meaning lion, were required to wear in future the five
                  symbols of the Khalsa, all beginning with the letter K- the
                  kesh or long hair and beard, Kangha, a comb in the kesh to
                  keep it tidy as against the recluses who kept it matted in
                  token of their having renounced the world, Kara, a steel
                  bracelet, Kachch, short breeches, and Kirpan, a sword. They
                  were enjoined to succour the helpless and fight the oppressor,
                  to have faith in one God and to consider all human beings
                  equal, irrespective of caste and creed. Sri Guru Gobind Singh
                  Ji then himself received initiatory rites from five disciples,
                  now invested with authority as Khalsa, and had his name
                  changed from Gobind Rai to Gobind Singh. “Hail,” as the poet
                  subsequently sang, “Gobind Singh who is himself Master as well
                  as disciple.” Further injunctions were laid down for the
                  Sikhs. They must never cut or trim their hair and beards, nor
                  smoke tobacco. A Sikh must not have sexual relationship
                  outside the marital bond, nor eat the flesh of an animal
                  killed slowly in the Muslim way.

                  These developments alarmed the caste ridden Rajput chiefs of
                  the Shivalik hills. They rallied under the leadership of the
                  Raja of Bilaspur, in whose territory lay Anandpur, to forcibly
                  evict Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji from his hilly citadel. Their
                  repeated expeditions during 1700-04 however proved abortive .
                  They at last petitioned Emperor Aurangzeb for help. In concert
                  with contingents sent under imperial orders by the governor of
                  Lahore and those of the faujdar of Sirhind, they marched upon
                  Anandpur and laid a siege to the fort in Jeth 1762 sk/May
                  1705. Over the months, the Guru and his Sikhs firmly withstood
                  their successive assaults despite dire scarcity of food
                  resulting from the prolonged blockade. While the besieged were
                  reduced to desperate straits, the besiegers too were chagrined
                  at the tenacity with which the Sikhs held out. At this stagy
                  the besiegers offered, on solemn oaths of Quran, safe exit to
                  the Sikhs if they quit Anandpur. At last, the town was
                  evacuated during the night of Poh suds 1, 1762 sk/5-6 December
                  1705. But soon, as the Guru and his Sikhs came out, the hill
                  monarchs and their Mughal allies set upon them in full fury.
                  In the ensuing confusion many Sikhs were killed and all of the
                  Guru’s baggage, including most of the precious manuscripts,
                  was lost. The Guru himself was able to make his way to
                  Chamkaur, 40 km southwest of Anandpur, with barely 40 Sikhs
                  and his two elder sons. There the imperial army, following
                  closely on his heels, caught up with him. His two sons, Ajit
                  Singh (b. 1687) and Jujhar Singh (b. 1691) and all but five of
                  the Sikhs fell in the action that took place on 7 December
                  1705. The five surviving Sikhs bade the Guru to save himself
                  in order to re-consolidate the Khalsa. Sri Guru Gobind Singh
                  Ji with three of his Sikhs escaped into the wilderness of the
                  Malva, two of his Muslim devotees, Gani Khan and Nabi Khan,
                  helping him at great personal risk.

                  Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji’s two younger sons, Zorawar Singh (b.
                  1696) and Fateh Singh (b.1699), and his mother, Mata Gujari,
                  were after the evacuation of Anandpur betrayed by their old
                  servant and escort, Gangu, to the faujdar of Sirhind, who had
                  the young children executed on 13 December 1705. Their
                  grandmother died the same day. Befriended by another Muslim
                  admirer, Rai Kalha of Raikot, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji reached
                  Dina in the heart of the Malva. There he enlisted a few
                  hundred warriors of the Brar clan, and also composed his
                  famous letter, Zafarnama or the Epistle of Victory, in Persian
                  verse, addressed to Emperor Aurangzeb. The letter was a severe
                  indictment of the Emperor and his commanders who had perjured
                  their oath and treacherously attacked him once he was outside
                  the safety of his fortification at Anandpur. It emphatically
                  reiterated the sovereignty of morality in the affairs of State
                  as much as in the conduct of human beings and held the means
                  as important as the end. Two of the Sikhs, Daya Singh and
                  Dharam Singh, were despatched with the Zafarnama to Ahmadnagar
                  in the South to deliver it to Aurangzeb, then in camp in that
                  town.

                  From Dina, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji continued his westward
                  march until, finding the host close upon his heels, he took
                  position astride the water pool of Khidrana to make a
                  last-ditch stand. The fighting on 29 December 1705 was hard
                  and desperate. In spite of their overwhelming numbers, the
                  Mughal troops failed to capture the Guru and had to retire in
                  defeat. The most valorous part in this battle was played by a
                  group of 40 Sikhs who had deserted the Guru at Anandpur during
                  the long siege, but who, chided by their womenfolk at home,
                  had come back under the leadership of a brave and devoted
                  woman, Mai Bhago, to redeem themselves. They had fallen
                  fighting desperately to check the enemy’s advance towards the
                  Guru’s position. The Guru blessed the 40 dead as 40 mukte,
                  i.e. the 40 Saved Ones. The site is now marked by a sacred
                  shrine and tank and the town which has grown around them is
                  called Muktsar, the Pool of liberations.

                  After spending some time in the Lakkhi Jungle country, Sri
                  Guru Gobind Singh Ji arrived at Talwandi Sabo, now called
                  Damdama Sahib, on 20 January 1706. During his stay there of
                  over nine months, a number of Sikhs rejoined him. He prepared
                  a fresh recension of Sikh Scripture, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib
                  Ji, with the celebrated scholar, Bhai Mani Singh, as his
                  amanuensis. From the number of scholars who had rallied round
                  Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji and from the literary activity
                  initiated, the place came to be known as the Guru’s Kashi or
                  seat of learning like Varanasi. The epistle Zafarnama sent by
                  Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji from Dina seems to have touched the
                  heart of Emperor Aurangzeb. He forthwith invited him for a
                  meeting. According to Ahkam-i-Alamgiri, the Emperor had a
                  letter written to the deputy governor of Lahore, Mun’im Khan,
                  to conciliate the Guru and make the required arrangements for
                  his journey to the Deccan. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji had,
                  however, already left for the South on 30 October 1706. He was
                  in the neighbourhood of Baghor, in Rajasthan, when the news
                  arrived of the death of the Emperor at Ahmadnagar on 20
                  February 1707. The Guru there upon decided to return to the
                  Punjab, via Shahjahanabad (Delhi) . That was the time when the
                  sons of the deceased Emperor were preparing to contest
                  succession. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji despatched for the help
                  of the eldest claimant, the liberal Prince Muazzam, a token
                  contingent of Sikhs which took part in the battle of Jajau (8
                  June 1707), decisively won by the Prince who ascended the
                  throne with the title of Bahadur Shah. The new Emperor invited
                  Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji for a meeting which took place at
                  Agra on 23 July 1707.

                  Emperor Bahadur Shah had at this time to move against the
                  Kachhwaha Rajputs of Amber (Jaipur) and then to the Deccan
                  where his youngest brother, Kam Baksh, had raised the standard
                  of revolt. The Guru accompanied him and, as says Tarikh-i-
                  Bahadur Shahi, he addressed assemblies of people on the way
                  preaching the word of Guru Nanak. The two camps crossed the
                  River Tapti between 11 and 14 June 1708 and the Ban-Ganga on
                  14 August, arriving at Nanded, on the Godavari, towards the
                  end of August. While Bahadur Shah proceeded further South, Sri
                  Guru Gobind Singh Ji decided to stay awhile at Nanded. Here he
                  met a Bairagi recluse, Madho Das, whom he converted a Sikh
                  administering to him Khande Di Pahul, renaming him Gurbaksh
                  Singh (popular name Banda Singh ). Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji
                  gave Banda Singh five arrows from his own quiver and an
                  escort, including five of his chosen Sikhs, and directed him
                  to go to the Punjab and carry on the campaign against the
                  tyranny of the provincial overlords.

                  Nawab Wazir Khan of Sirhind had felt concerned at the
                  Emperor’s conciliatory treatment of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
                  Their marching together to the South made him jealous, and he
                  charged two of his trusted men with murdering the Guru before
                  his increasing friendship with the Emperor resulted in any
                  harm to him. These two pathans Jamshed Khan and Wasil Beg are
                  the names given in the Guru Kian Sakhian— pursued the Guru
                  secretly and overtook him at Nanded, where, according to Sri
                  Gur Sobha by Senapati, a contemporary writer, one of them
                  stabbed the Guru in the left side below the heart as he lay
                  one evening in his chamber resting after the Rehras prayer.
                  Before he could deal another blow, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji
                  struck him down with his sword, while his fleeing companion
                  fell under the swords of Sikhs who had rushed in on hearing
                  the noise. As the news reached Bahadur Shah’s camp, he sent
                  expert surgeons, including an Englishman, Cole by name, to
                  attend on the Guru. The wound was stitched and appeared to
                  have healed quickly but, as the Guru one day applied strength
                  to pull a stiff bow, it broke out again and bled profusely.
                  This weakened the Guru beyond cure and he passed away on
                  Kattak sudi 5, 1765 Bk/7 OC tober 1708. Before the end came,
                  Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji had asked for the Sacred Volume to be
                  brought forth. To quote Bhatt Vahi Taloda Parganah Jind: “Guru
                  Gobind Singh, the Tenth Master, son of Guru Teg Bahadur,
                  grandson of Guru Hargobind, great-grandson of Guru Arjan, of
                  the family of Guru Ram Das Suraj Bansi, Gosal clan, Sodhi
                  Khatri, resident of Anandpur, parganah Kahlur, now at Nanded,
                  in the Godavari country in the Deccan, asked Bhai Daya Singh,
                  on Wednesday, 6 October 1708, to fetch Sri Guru Granth Sahib.
                  In obedience to his orders, Daya Singh brought Sri Guru Granth
                  Sahib. The Guru placed before it five pice and a coconut and
                  bowed his head before it. He said to the sangat, “It is my
                  commandment: Own Sri Granth ji in my place. He who so
                  acknowledges it will obtain his reward. The Guru will rescue
                  him. Know this as the truth”.
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji thus passed on the succession with
                  due ceremony to the Holy Book, the Guru Granth Sahib, ending
                  the line of personal Gurus. “The Guru’s spirit,” he said,
                  “will henceforth be in the Granth and the Khalsa. Where the
                  Granth is with any five Sikhs representing the Khalsa, there
                  will the Guru be.” The Word enshrined in the Holy Book was
                  always revered by the Gurus as well as by their disciples as
                  of Divine origin. The Guru was the revealer of the Word. One
                  day the Word was to take the place of the Guru. The inevitable
                  came to pass when Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji declared the Guru
                  Granth Sahib as his successor. It was only through the Word
                  that the Guruship could be made everlasting. The Word as
                  contained in the Guru Granth Sahib was henceforth, and for all
                  time to come to be the Guru for the Sikhs.
