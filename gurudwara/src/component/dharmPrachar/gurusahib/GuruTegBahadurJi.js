                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was born on Vaisakh Vadi 5, (5
                  Vaisakh), Bikrami Samvat 1678, (1st April, 1621) in the holy
                  city of Amritsar in a house known as Guru ke Mahal. He had
                  four brothers Baba Gurditta Ji, Baba Suraj Mal Ji, Baba Ani
                  Rai Ji, Baba Atal Rai Ji and one sister Bibi Veero Ji. He was
                  the fifth and the youngest son of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji
                  and Mata Nanki Ji. His childhood name was Tyag Mal. The Sikhs
                  began to call him Teg Bahadur after the battle of Kartarpur
                  against Painda Khan in which he proved to be great
                  sword-player or gladiator. But he preferred to call himself
                  ‘Tegh Bahadur’
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  From the very childhood Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji used to sit
                  inside the house and spend most of his time in meditation. He
                  seldom played with other boys of his age. Due to the rich
                  religious atmosphere at home he developed a distinct
                  philosophical bent of mind. Naturally he developed
                  inspirations towards a life of selfless service and sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji had a regular schooling from the age
                  of six. Where he also learnt classical, vocal and instrumental
                  music. Bhai Gurdas Ji also taught him Gurbani and Hindu
                  Mythology. Apart from the schooling he was also given the
                  military training like horsemanship, swordsmanship, javelin
                  throwing and shooting. He had witnessed and even participated
                  in the battles of Amritsar and Kartarpur. But in spite of all
                  this, he developed an extraordinary mystic nature in due
                  course of time.

                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was married to Gujri Ji (Mata),
                  daughter of Sh.Lal Chand & Bishan Kaur of Kartarpur at an
                  early age on 15 Assu, Samvat 1689 (September 14, 1632). A son
                  (Guru) Gobind Singh (Sahib) was born on Poh Sudi Saptmi Samvat
                  1723 (December 22,1666). Gujri (Mata) was also a religious
                  lady. She was disciplined in behaviour and modest in
                  temperament. Her father was a noble and rich man. Soon after
                  the death of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, Mata Nanki Ji, the
                  mother of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji took him and his wife
                  (Gujri) to her natal village (Baba) Bakala near the river
                  Beas. Some Chronicles state that Bhai Mehra, who was a devout
                  Sikh of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, got constructed a house
                  for Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji where he lived in complete peace
                  and led a normal life for the next twenty years (from 1644 to
                  1666).

                <p className="text1">
                  It is a totally wrong conception (as some historian point out)
                  that Guru Sahib got constructed a solitary cell in his house
                  where he often used to meditate God. Actually, it is seen that
                  the meditation for self-purification and self-attainment of
                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji is wrongly misunderstood. Guru
                  Nanak’s spiritual traditions hold that after attaining the
                  divine light, one has to lift others from darkness to liberate
                  the world. In JapJi sahib, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji says: ” There
                  can be no love of God without active service.” Sri Guru Tegh
                  Bahadur Ji’s long spell of silent meditation perfected his
                  will. Through meditation Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji archived the
                  torch of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji creative vision. He developed
                  aspirations towards a life of selfless service and sacrifice,
                  with a moral and spiritual courage to abide by the will of
                  God. When Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji invested Sri Guru Har
                  Rai Ji with Guruship, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was the first
                  to bow to Sri Guru Har Rai Ji. He never contested the will of
                  his father (Guru).

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  During the stay at Baba Bakala, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji paid
                  visits to many holy and historical places like Goindwal,
                  Kiratpur Sahib, Haridwar, Prayag, Mathura, Agra, Kashi
                  (Banaras) and Gaya. A devoted Sikh of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur
                  Ji, Bhai Jetha Ji took Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji to Patna. Here
                  he heard the news of the passing away of Sri Guru Har Rai Ji
                  (6th Oct, 1661) and decided to return to Kiratpur Sahib. On
                  the way back he reached Delhi on March, 21,1664, where he
                  learnt the arrival of Sri Guru Harkrishan Ji at the residence
                  of Raja Jai Singh. He alongwith his mother and other Sikhs
                  paid visit to Sri Guru Harkrishan Ji and after expressing
                  profound sense of sorrow and sympathy towards Guru Sahib and
                  his mother Mata Krishan Kaur Ji, he left for Baba Bakala
                  (Punjab).

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  After some days, Sri Guru Harkrishan Ji (on the eve of his
                  death), prophetically uttered only two words “Baba Bakala”
                  meaning that his successor would be found at (Baba) Bakala.
                  Now with this announcement near about twenty-two posers and
                  self- appointed successors sprung up in the small village
                  Bakala. The most prominent among them was Dhir Mal who was the
                  only direct descendant of the eldest son Baba Gurditta Ji and
                  it was he who possessed the first copy of Guru Granth Sahib
                  prepared by Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  This situation puzzled the innocent Sikh devotees for a few
                  months. Then in the month of August 1664, Sikh Sangat headed
                  by some prominent Sikhs from Delhi, arrived at village Bakala
                  and acknowledged Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji as the Ninth Nanak,
                  but the atmosphere remained same at Village Baba Bakala. Sri
                  Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji accepted the spiritual succession but
                  never liked to be dragged into the mire of competition with
                  the imposters. He kept aloof from them. An incident, which
                  changed the whole scene deciding the dispute forever, occurred
                  one day.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  Makhan Shah Lubana, a rich trader and a devout Sikh from Tanda
                  district Jhelum (now in Pakistan), came to pay his obeisance
                  and 500 gold coins as offerings to the Guru Sahib, at village
                  Bakala. It is said that earlier his ship full of merchandise
                  was caught in a storm. But due to his prayer to the Guru
                  Sahib, his ship was saved. He made up his mind to offer 500
                  gold coins in lieu of the safety. Reaching village Bakala he
                  had to encounter so many ‘Gurus’. Everyone contested to be the
                  real ‘Guru’. He offered everyone only two coins and none-of
                  them challenged. The imposters were glad to accept only two
                  coins. But he was disappointed as he sensed something wrong.
                </p>
                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  One day he learned from some villagers that there was also
                  another Guru named Tegh Bahadur Ji. He went to see the Guru
                  who was meditating in a lone house. When he offered two coins
                  to Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the later questioned that why
                  Makhan Shah was breaking his own promise offering only two
                  coins instead of five hundred. At this Makhan Shah could not
                  contain himself with joy. He immediately climbed to the roof
                  of the same house and cried loudly that he had discovered the
                  true Guru (Guru Ladho Re…Guru Ladho Re…). On hearing this a
                  large number of Sikh devotees assembled there and paid their
                  homage to the true Guru. This incident ravaged Dhir Mal and he
                  with the hired ruffians, attacked Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji. A
                  bullet hit Guru Sahib and when the Sikhs learnt about this
                  attack, they retaliated and took possession of (Guru) Granth
                  Sahib lying with Dhir Mal. But Guru Sahib returned it to Dhir
                  Mal while forgiving him.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji with his entire family reached
                  Amritsar (about November, 1664) to pay obeisance at Harmandir
                  Sahib, but the ministers of the holy place shut its doors
                  against him and he was not allowed to enter. Sri Guru Tegh
                  Bahadur Ji did not pressed or forced his entry but returned
                  calmly and reached Kiratpur Sahib via Vallah, Khandur Sahib,
                  Goindwal Sahib, Tarn Taran Sahib, Khem karan. Before reaching
                  Kiratpur, he also visited Talwandi Sabo Ke, Banger and
                  Dhandaur. It is to be noted that wherever Guru Sahib went,
                  there he established new Manjis (preaching centres of
                  Sikhism). Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib reached Kiratpur Sahib in
                  May 1665. In June 1665 Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji bought some
                  land from Raja of Bilaspur near Makhowal village on the bank
                  of River Satlej and founded a new town Chak-Nanki after
                  revered name of his mother Nanaki. Later this town was renamed
                  as Sri Anandpur Sahib.
                </p>
                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  After a brief stay at new founded town, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur
                  Ji set out for a long journey towards the east in order to
                  strengthen the Sikh nation by setting up new preaching centers
                  and renewing the old ones. It was his second missionary tour.
                  He left Anandpur Sahib in August, 1665 along with many staunch
                  sikhs such as Bhai Mati Das Ji, Bhai Sati Das Ji, Bhai Sangtia
                  Ji, Bhai Dayal Das Ji and Bhai Jetha Ji apart from his close
                  family members. It was like a long-march for the sake of
                  suffering humanity. This mission raved the orthodox regime of
                  the Mughals, because large crowds began to attend the
                  gatherings and sought the Guru’s blessings. When Sri Guru Tegh
                  Bahadur Ji was coming at Dhamdhan in the Banger area in
                  December 1665 a Mughal enforcement officer Alam Khan Rohella
                  arrested him along with Bhai Sati Das Ji, Bhai Moti Das Ji,
                  Bhai Dayal Das Ji and some other Sikh followers under the
                  imperial orders from Delhi. All these were produced before the
                  court of the emperor Aurangzeb, who ordered to hand-over them
                  to Kanwar Ram Singh Kachhwaha, son of Raja Jai Singh Mirza.
                  The entire family of Raja Jai Singh was a staunch follower of
                  Guru Sahib and hence they treated him not like prisoner but
                  endorsed great respect and also secured the releasing orders
                  from the imperial court. Guru Sahib was released after about
                  two months. Resuming his mission further, Guru Sahib reached
                  Mathura and then Agra and from here he reached Allahabad via
                  Etawah, Kanpur and Fatehpur. He also visited Benaras and
                  Sasaram and then reached Patna in the month of May 1666.

                  Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji proceeded further towards Dacca via
                  Mongair, Calicut (now Kolkata), Sahibganj and Kant Nagar in
                  October 1666. But before leaving for these places he made
                  necessary arrangements under the supervision of a devout Sikh
                  lady known as Mata Paidi for the safe stay of his family
                  members at Patna during the rainy season. Then Mata Gujri Ji
                  was expecting a child. At all the places Guru Sahib halted,
                  Satsangat and Kirtan (recitations of Verses from Guru Granth
                  Sahib) were held daily and religious sermons were delivered.
                  Many prominent Sikhs like Bhai Mati Dass Ji, Bhai Sati Das Ji,
                  Bhai Dayal Das Ji and Baba Gurditta Ji, supported Guru Sahib
                  in religious sittings during these tours.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  At Dacca Guru Sahib established a big Sangat (Hazuri Sangat)
                  with the help of ardent followers like Almast Ji and Natha
                  Sahib. A Gurdwara Sangat Tola now marks the place where Guru
                  Sahib used to deliver holy sermons to the audience. It was
                  here that Guru Sahib heard the news of the birth of his son,
                  (Guru Gobind Singh Sahib) who was born on Poh Sudi Saptami (23
                  Poh) Bikrami Samvat 1723, (December, 22,1666) at Patna.From
                  Dacca, Guru Sahib proceeded towards Jatia Hills and Sylhet
                  where he established a preaching Centre for Sikh Sangat and
                  reached Chittagong via Agartala.

                  Guru Sahib returned Dacca in 1668. At this time Raja Ram Singh
                  son of Late Raja Jai Singh who was already present at Dacca in
                  order to make arrangements for his expedition to Assam, met
                  Guru Sahib and sought blessings. (Some Chronicles state that
                  Raja Ram Singh met Guru Sahib at Gaya). As Guru Sahib was
                  already touring the Far East places, Raja Ram Singh requested
                  Guru Sahib to accompany him during the expedition. Guru Sahib
                  did so. During this tour Guru Sahib meditated on the banks of
                  river Brahmaputra at Dhubri in Assam where stands a Gurdwara
                  known as Sri Damdama Sahib. Earlier Guru Nanak Sahib also
                  sanctified this place. It is said that by the grace of Guru
                  Tegh Bahadur Sahib, there was a peaceful settlement instead of
                  bloody conformation between the ruler of Kamrup and Raja Ram
                  Singh. Guru Sahib left Assam in April-May, 1670 and returned
                  Patna.

                  A reign of terror was let loose on the Hindus in India by the
                  Muslim theistic state. The prosecution of Hindus was the most
                  outrageous feature of his reign. Aurangzeb made up his mind to
                  rout out Hinduism from India by hook or crook, and introduced
                  many Islamic fundamentalist programs like special taxes for
                  the Hindu traders, religious tax (Zazia) for non-Muslims.
                  Celebration of Diwali and Holi was forbidden. He demolished
                  many important and sacred Hindu Temples, and erected mosques
                  in place of them. Chronicles state that some Sikh Gurdwaras

                  arrested at Agra along with many of his prominent Sikhs in
                  June 1670. They were produced before an imperial court at
                  Delhi but released shortly. Guru Sahib returned Anandpur Sahib
                  in February 1671. He spent about two years there peacefully
                  preaching Sikhism. Here he identified himself with the sorrows

                  area was backward and almost neglected, but the people were
                  hard working and poor. They were also deprived of basic
                  amenities like fresh drinking water, milk and even simple
                  food. Guru Sahib toured this area about one and half year.

                  He helped villagers in many ways. Guru Sahib and Sikh Sangat
                  assisted them in planting trees on barren stretches of land.
                  They were also advised to start dairy farming and in this
                  respect many cattle heads were also distributed free of cost
                  among the poor and landless farmers. To cope with the scarcity
                  of water many community wells were dug on the behest of Guru
                  Sahib by performing Kar-Sewa (free service). Thus Guru Sahib
                  identified himself with the common masses. At this stage many
                  followers of Sakhi Sarwar (a muslim outfit) entered into the
                  fold of Sikhism. On the other hand Guru Sahib established many
                  new preaching centres of Sikhism at these places. The main and
                  important halts of Guru Sahib were Patiala (Dukhniwaran
                  Sahib), Samaon, Bhiki, Tahla Sahib, and Talwandi in Bhatinda,
                  Gobindpura, Makrora, Bangar and Dhamdhan. Guru Sahib toured
                  these areas about one and a half years and returned Anandpur
                  Sahib in 1675.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  These preaching tours and social works irked the Muslim
                  fundamentalists and created a fear-psyche among the upper
                  privileged classes. On the other hand the secret news-writers
                  of the Mughal Empire dispatched exaggerated and subjective
                  reports regarding the religious activities of Guru Tegh
                  Bahadur Sahib.

                  As it is mentioned earlier that the Muslim theistic state
                  executed forceful conversions in order to make India,
                  Dar-ul-Islam and to achieve this goal as soon as possible, the
                  Hindu Pandits and Brahmins (the preaching class) of Kashi,
                  Prayag, Kurukshetra, Haridwar and Kashmir were identified for
                  this purpose. All types of atrocities were let loose on them.
                  They were given an ultimatum either to embrace Islam or to be
                  prepared for death. It is regretted that all this was done
                  under the very nose of many so-called brave Hindu and Rajput
                  kings and chiefs who were also subordinate to the imperial
                  state of Delhi. They were only silent spectators aiming at
                  their own ends. They even did not raise a minor voice of
                  protest against the nefarious acts of Aurangzeb. There was a
                  wave of mass conversion in India and Sher Afgan Khan an
                  imperial viceroy first tried this practice in Kashmir.
                  Thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were massacred and their
                  property was looted.
                </p>
                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  At this juncture, the Brahmins especially the Kashmiri Pandits
                  led by Pandit Kirpa Ram Dutt approached Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur
                  Ji at Anandpur Sahib in May 1675. They told their tales of woe
                  to Guru Sahib and requested to protect their honor and faith.
                  Guru Sahib heard their views and agreed to resist the
                  nefarious act of forcible conversions by peaceful means. After
                  long discussions with the prominent Sikhs and Kashmiri
                  Pandits, Guru Sahib made up his mind to sacrifice himself for
                  the cause of “Righteousness” and for the freedom of
                  “Dharma”(Religion) On the advice of Guru Sahib, the Kashmiri
                  Pandits presented a petition to the Emperor and in lieu of
                  this an imperial court of Delhi, issued summons asking Sri
                  Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji to appear in the said court. But on the
                  other hand, before the imperial summons reach Anandpur Sahib,
                  Guru Sahib started his journey towards Delhi after installing
                  his son (Guru) Gobind Sahib as the Tenth Nanak in July 1675.
                  Bhai Dayal Das Ji, Bhai Moti Das Ji, Bhai Sati Das Ji and many
                  more devoted Sikhs followed Guru Sahib. When Sri Guru Tegh
                  Bahadur Ji reached near village Malikpur Ragharan near Ropar,
                  an imperial armed contingent led by Mirza Nur Mohammad Khan,
                  arrested Guru Sahib and some of his prominent followers. He
                  kept them in a prison at Bassi Pathanan and tortured daily.
                  Now it was the turn of Guru Sahib who remained calm & quite.
                  The authorities offered three alternatives viz : (1) To show
                  miracles, or (2) to embrace Islam, or (3) to prepare himself
                  for death. Guru Sahib accepted the last. On seeing Guru Sahib
                  adamant and immoveable, the authorities ordered the
                  executioner (Jallad) to sever the head from the body. The
                  order was implemented. The historians quote this date as
                  November 11, 1675 AD. (Gurdwara Sis Ganj at Chandni Chowk
                  marks the place where the execution was done.) There was a
                  furious storm after this brutal deed. It caused confusion and
                  havoc in and around the city. Under these circumstances Bhai
                  Jaita Ji, took away the holy head of Guru Sahib, placed it in
                  a basket, covered it carefully and set out of Anandpur Sahib.
                  He reached Kiratpur Sahib, near Anandpur Sahib on 15th
                  November. He was received with great honour by young Guru
                  Gobind Rai and honoured as “Rangretta Guru Ka Beta.” The
                  cremation of head was performed with full honour and proper
                  ceremonies on the next day. (Gurdwara Sis Ganj also marks the
                  place where the head was cremated.) Taking advantage of the
                  same situation the other part of the body of Sri Guru Tegh
                  Bahadur Ji was whisked away by a brave Sikh Lakhi Shah Lubana
                  a famous merchant and contractor and he immediately built up a
                  pyre inside his house and set fire to it in the evening. Thus
                  whole house including other valuables were burned and
                  destroyed. It is said that a royal police guard arrived at the
                  scene in search of the body, but returned, finding the house
                  burning and the inmates weeping bitterly. (Now Gurdwara Rakab
                  Ganj in New Delhi, marks the place.)

                  The martyrdom of Guru Sahib had for reaching consequences and
                  deeply influenced the history of India. It exposed the
                  fundamental theistic nature of the contemporary state,
                  highlighted tyranny and injustice. It made the people of India
                  hate Aurangzeb and his government as never before and turned
                  the Sikh Nation into militant people. It made them feels that
                  they could protect their religion (Dharma) only but the
                  defense of arms. It proposed the way for the final stage in
                  creation of the Khalsa, which played the most important and
                  significant role in the history of India.

                  Guru Sahib was also a great poet and thinker. For an example
                  we may quote him, as one of his Slokas, he says: Bhai Kahu kau
                  det naih naih bhai manat ann, kahu nanak sunu re mana gaini
                  tahi bakhan. (SGGS 1427) (Sayth Nanak, he who holds none in
                  fear, mor in afraid of anyone, acknowledge his alone as a man
                  of true wisdom) Guru Sahib written Gurbani in fifteen Raagas
                  apart from 57 salokas, got included in Guru Granth Sahib by
                  the 10th master, Guru Gobind Singh Sahib.
