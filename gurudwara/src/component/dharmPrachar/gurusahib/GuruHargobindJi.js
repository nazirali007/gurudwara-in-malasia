                  Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji was born at village Guru Ki Wadali
                  (district Amritsar) on Harh Vadi 7th (21 Harh), Samvat 1652
                  (19th June, 1595). He was extremely handsome and the only son
                  of Guru Arjan Sahib and Mata Ganga Ji. He had one daughter
                  Bibi Viro Ji and five sons: Baba Gurditta Ji, Suraj Mal Ji,
                  Ani Rai Ji, Atal Rai Ji and (Guru) Tegh Bahadur Ji. Out of
                  these, four sons passed away during the life of Guru Sahib and
                  the fifth one, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji become Ninth Nanak in
                  1664. Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji succeeded Guru Arjan Sahib
                  in 1606, at the age of eleven years. After the martyrdom of
                  Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the moment was crucial for the Sikhs.
                  Now for the first time, the Sikhs began to think seriously to
                  counter the high-handedness of the mighty and theist Muslim
                  Empire. Now a change had taken place in the character of Sikh
                  Nation on the force of circumstances. Dialectically speaking,
                  it was the need of the hour. Now the Sikh nation adopts both
                  spiritual and political ways simultaneously. This policy
                  suited well to all the social and economic segments of the
                  Sikhs.
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji wore two swords, one of Spiritual
                  Power – Piri and the other of Military Power – Miri. Now the
                  Sikh became “Saint-Soldier.” Guru Sahib issued various letters
                  advising the Sikhs to take part in the military training and
                  martial arts. A Chronicler states that Guru Sahib kept seven
                  hundred Cavaliers and sixty artillerymen. There was a band of
                  Pathan mercenaries and Painda Khan Pathan was made its chief.
                  Riding, hunting, wrestling and many others martial sports were
                  introduced. And on the other hand the martial songs like
                  ‘Vars’ were daily sung by the Dhadd-players in the court of
                  Guru Sahib to inspire the Sikhs of heroic deeds. Abdul and
                  Natha Mal were given the task in this respect. The Guru Sahib
                  himself was healthy and strong in body and mind. He himself
                  learnt the use of different weapons, besides riding wrestling
                  and hunting.
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  In due course of action, Guru Sahib erected a wall around
                  Amritsar city and constructed a small fort named ‘Lohgarh’ on
                  the outskirts of the city. Guru Sahib revealed Sri Akal Takht
                  Sahib also known as Akal Bunga (Timeless Throned) just in
                  front of Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in 1609. This
                  place became the seat of preaching and praying in due course
                  of time. At this place, Guru Sahib used to gave sermons to the
                  Sikhs and discussions were held on the problems faced by the
                  Sikh nation. In this way the Sikhs were encouraged to settle
                  their own disputes themselves, some martial sports were also
                  performed in the open courtyard before the Akal Takht. This
                  development further consolidated the Sikh nation. The Sikhs
                  call Guru Sahib ‘Sachcha Patshah’ (True Emperor) and the Sikh
                  Nation followed the judgments or decisions taken on Sri Akal
                  Takht Sahib enthusiastically. The emperor Jahangir did not
                  tolerated this new policy of Guru Sahib and subsequently
                  ordered to imprison him in the Gwalior Fort. Though the
                  various reasons are also ascribed for the detention of Guru
                  Sahib but the most suitable one seems to be that the Emperor
                  Jahangir was falsely alarmed (about the military preparations
                  by the Guru Sahib and Sikhs) by the same elements; enemies of
                  the Sikh Nation, who were earlier responsible for the
                  execution of Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji. After receiving summons
                  from Emperor Jahangir, Guru Sahib proceeded towards Delhi
                  before making serious consultations about rest, with all the
                  leading Sikh personalities including Mata Ganga Ji, Baba Budha
                  Ji, Bhai Gurdas Ji, Bhai Jetha Ji and Bhai Sahlo Ji. Guru
                  Sahib appeared before the Emperor Jahangir and was received by
                  the latter with due respect. A debate on Sikh religion and
                  Sikh doctrines held between Guru Sahib and Jahangir (having
                  pre-tempered mind against Guru Sahib) but the emperor remained
                  unimpressed and ordered for the imprisonment of Guru Sahib at
                  Gwalior Fort. Guru Sahib was detained in the fort upto three
                  years i.e. from 1609 to 1612. (There are divergent views
                  regarding the detention period of Guru Sahib in the Gwalior
                  Fort prison, but the most acceptable one seems to be three
                  years from 1609 to 1612.)

                <p className="text1">
                  Sain Mian Mir and Wazir Khan (Governor of Lahore) approached
                  Emperor Jahangir on behalf of Guru Sahib and secured the
                  releasing orders. When Guru Sahib met Jahangir immediately
                  after his release, he insisted upon Jahangir for the release
                  of other fifty-two Hindu Princes on his personal surety (These
                  Princes were said to be the rebellious ones). The request was
                  obliged and all the prisoners were released in 1612. Then the
                  title of “Bandi Chhor Baba” was given to Guru Sahib and is
                  still remembered by this name. Guru Sahib reached Amritsar on
                  the occasion of Diwali. This was a big occasion for the Sikhs.
                  It is said that Baba Budha Ji littered the earthen lamps
                  throughout the Amritsar city. The Sikhs celebrated this
                  occasion enthusiastically. From this day the Sikh Nation began
                  to celebrate Dewali festival as ” Bandi Chhor Diwas ” also.
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  Now the attitude of Jahangir and his empire towards Guru Sahib
                  changed considerably and remained favorable and friendly till
                  the death of Jahangir. It was the outcome of the noble
                  interceding by the religious, secular and political
                  personalities like Sain Mian Mir Ji, Nizam-ud-Din and the
                  Governor of Lahore, Wazir Khan. Shortly after the release of
                  Guru Sahib, the angry Sikhs overtook Chandu Shah (the main
                  brain behind the execution of Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji). They
                  preceded him through the streets of Lahore. Chandu, like a mad
                  dog, was pelted with stones, filth, and abuses thus put to
                  death. A chronicle further states that “Death came to him as a
                  relief and his body was thrown into the river Ravi.”

                  Shortly after the release from the Gwalior Fort and having
                  cordial relations with the state, Guru sahib started to
                  re-consolidate the Sikh Nation. He modified the concept of
                  Charanamrit, (system of initiating people into the fold of
                  Sikhism, which was being exploited by the selfish and corrupt
                  Masands according to their own interests, when Guru Sahib was
                  in Gwalior prison). He tried his best to dissuade Meharban
                  (son of Prithi Chand) from harbouring hostile designs against
                  Sikhs and Sikhism.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  Guru Sahib undertook Dharam Parchar tours to spread Sikhism.
                  He started from Amritsar and covered thousand miles in India.
                  In Punjab he visited Kartarpur and made it as headquarter of
                  Sikh Nation in Doaba. He also visited several adjoining
                  villages like Bara Pir, Mukerian and laid the foundation stone
                  of Sri Hargobindpur town (the original name of this town was
                  Gobindpura) near the river Beas in 1621. Guru Sahib also
                  covered the ‘Malwa’ region of Punjab where the cult of Hindu
                  Goddess and “Sakhi Sarwar” was fascination the lowly and
                  downtrodden simple living people. Guru Sahib admitted the
                  people of the villages: Darauli, Mehraj, Damru, Dabwali,
                  Sidhwan, Sidhar, Lopo, Zeera, Katra and Gillan in the Sikhism.
                  In other words the entire Malwa region embraced Sikhism and
                  went a long way in integrating the Sikh Nation. This was a
                  major achievement by Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Sri Guru
                  Hargobind Sahib Ji visited an old Sikh religious parching
                  centre Nanakmatta (Gorakh Matta) in the present Pilibhit
                  district of U.P. Guru Nanak Sahib established it. It is said
                  that some Hindu Yogis ousted Almast Ji, (a pious Sikh
                  preacher, deputed by Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji to spread
                  Sikhism) from the gurdwara and desecrated the place by cutting
                  the holy and historical Peepal tree, under which earlier Sri
                  Guru Nanak Dev Ji held discussions with the different sects of
                  Jogis. Guru Sahib reached Nanakmatta along with some
                  saint-soldiers. Seeing Guru Sahib on the scene, the Yogis fled
                  away and never came back or interfered in the religious
                  affairs of Almast Ji. Guru Sahib returned Amritsar via
                  Darauli. Guru Sahib also held a detailed discussion on the
                  spiritual and religious with a marathe Saint Ram Das Samrath,
                  on the spiritual and religious issues in a very cordial
                  atmosphere at Srinagar (Garhwal).

                  Guru Sahib visited Kashmir in 1620. Some chronicles state that
                  Guru Sahib went there at the invitation of emperor Jahangir,
                  because his personal physician’s advice for a natural climate
                  and atmospheric change. It is also stated that Jahangir and
                  his party paid a visit to Goindwal Sahib and reached Amritsar
                  via Taran Taran. The emperor offered financial assistance for
                  the construction of Sri Akal Takht Sahib, but Guru Sahib
                  declined the offer politely.

                  On the other hand some Sikh source term the visit to Kashmir
                  as a part of Guru Sahib’s preaching campaign. Guru Hargobind
                  Sahib patronized one Sewa Das for preaching Sikhism. He and
                  his mother Bhag Bhari served Guru Sahib with much zeal and
                  devotion. Guru Sahib held a short meeting with his many
                  devoted Sikhs and a preacher Kattu Shah (a converted
                  Mohammedan). Guru Sahib visited Sialkot, Wazirabad, Mirpur,
                  Bhimbar Tehran, Baramula, Uri and Muzaffarabad. He appointed
                  Bhai Garhia Ji to preach the Sikh religion. The large number
                  of Kashmiris, both Hindus and Muslims embraced Sikhism due to
                  the devoted and committed preaching by Guru Sahib. He married
                  Bibi Marwahi Ji (Mata Mahadevi Ji), the daughter of a devoted
                  Sikh couple Daya Ram Ji and Bhagan Ji at village Mandiali.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  Guru Sahib spent the last decade of his life (from 1635 to
                  1644) at Kiratpur Sahib, which is situated in the hill state
                  of Hadur (Nalagarh), founded by Baba Gurditta Ji (Guru’s son).
                  It is said that Raja Tara Chand donated land for this purpose.
                  Guru Sahib devoted his much time in reorganizing the Sikh
                  Nation and updating the preaching centres by establishing a
                  new system called Dhunas. Baba Gurditta Ji was made the
                  incharge of religious affairs and he further appointed four
                  head preachers area vice: Almast Ji, Phaul Ji, Gonda Ji and
                  Baba Hansa Ji. Guru Sahib made reconciliation with Udasi sect
                  headed by Baba Sri Chand Ji. Guru Sahib’s religious tours and
                  preaching made the Sikhism more popular in different parts of
                  India. On the other hand Guru Sahib did not abandoned the
                  mission of militarizing the Sikhs. Now for the first time in
                  the Indian history since the invasion of Muslims, the Sikh
                  Nation, under the supreme command of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib
                  Ji, prepared for the armed resistance. The tyranny and
                  injustice of the Muslim theocratic state was opposed. This was
                  only an imperative measure of defense. Guru Sahib converted
                  the peaceful sect into a warlike community, ready to defend
                  their interests with the swords and it was the need of the
                  hour.

                  After the death of emperor Jahangir the policy matter of the
                  new young emperor Shah Jahan changed considerably. The emperor
                  took the notice of new converts to Sikhism from the Muslims.
                  He ordered to destroy all the temples and Gurdwaras, which
                  were under construction. The sacred Baoli of Guru Arjan Sahib
                  in Dabbi Babar, Lahore (now in Pakistan) was desecrated and
                  converted into a mosque. (Later Maharaja RanJit Singh
                  re-excavated and re-established this Baoli. Again it was
                  destroyed in 1947, by the unruly and fanatic Muslims mob). On
                  the other hand the influence of Naqashbandis (a radical and
                  fundamentalist order of the Muslim clergy). In 1629 Mukhlis
                  Khan was made the Governor to Lahore. He and Qazi Rustam Khan
                  were best friends. According to some historical accounts
                  Kaulan(Mata), a Hindu lady , as it is also signified to by the
                  name Kaulan, was forcibly abducted by the Qazi Rustam Khan in
                  her childhood and was made a maid servant . She was treated
                  like a slave .At the young age; she came under the influence
                  of the teachings of Sain Mian Mir Ji. She also began to take
                  part in the religious sittings of Guru Sahib and became an
                  ardent and pious follower of Guru Sahib.
                </p>
                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  On noticing this attitude of Kaulan Ji, Qazi became harsher
                  towards her .How a Qazi, an extreme fanatic personality;
                  tolerate her deep and devotional interest in Sikh religion?
                  Because of Qazi’s harsh treatment she sought the help of Mian
                  Mir Ji, who deputed his disciple Abdullah (Abdul Yar Khan) to
                  escort Kaulan Ji safely to Amritsar, Where she was treated
                  kindly by Guru Sahib and provided her a safe and separate
                  lodging near a pond, (later it was converted into a tank by
                  Guru Sahib and named it Kaulsar, after the name of Kaulan Ji).
                  She was a pious disciple of Guru Sahib and an ardent follower
                  of Sikhism. She began to arrange religious congregations on
                  Sikhism and Gurbani, at her residence. Within a short span of
                  time she became much popular among the Sikh masses. Thus she
                  won the sympathy of the Sikhs who began to address her as Mata
                  Kaulan Ji. She breathed her last on 4th July 1629 at Kartarpur
                  (Jalandhar) while serving for the Sikh Nation.

                When Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after the death of his father Jahangir, Qazi Rustam Khan lodged a complaint with the new emperor, who was incensed earlier by the fanatic Muslims and Hindus against the Sikh Nation and Guru Sahib. He obliged the complaint and revised his policy matter; earlier adopted by his father Jahangir towards Guru Sahib.The possible conflict out of charged circumstances was inevitable. Guru Sahib fought five battles during the regime of emperor Shah Jahan, and all were won. A small conflict of Rohilla near Sri Hargobindpur was fought in 1621. It was the first armed clash between the Faujdar of Jalandhar and Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji.

                Near the site of new town Hargobindpur, Bhagwan Das, a Khatri ‘Kirar’ contemplated his right of ownership on the land and with the help of some hired ruffians forcibly tried to dislodge the Sikhs, who were engaged in developing the new township. In the ensuing small clash Bhagwan Das and his most hired ruffians were killed. After this incident, Rattan Chand (son of Bhagwan Das) and Karam Chand (son of Chandu Mal) incensed the Faujdar of Jalandhar against Guru Sahib. Abdulla Khan the Faujdar of Jalandhar dispatched ten thousand soldiers. They were intercepted by the mighty and devoted Sikh Saint-Soldiers at Rohilla Ghat on the bank of the river Beas. The Mughal army met a crushing defeat by the hands of, but there was an immense loss of lives and material on the both sides. Besides Rattan Chand and Karam Chand, the Faujdar of Jalandhar, Abdullah Khan his two sons and five commanders were killed. Guru Sahib sacrificed Saint Soldiers like Madhura Bhat Ji (son of Baba Bhikha Ji), Bhai Nanu Ji, Bhai Saktu Ji, Bhai Jattu Ji, Bhai Pirana Ji, Bhai Paras Ram Ji, Bhai Jagannath Ji and Bhai Kalyana Ji. The second and the most serious conflict between Guru Sahib and the Mughal forces were fought in April 1634. It started with the lifting of a royal hawk of the imperial army of Shah Jahan by the Sikhs, who incidentally were also hunting in the same territory around Gumtala Village near Amritsar. This led to a small violent conflict between the two parties. Guru Hargobind Sahib was not directly involved in his clash.

                This incident enraged the emperor, Shah Jahan. He deputed Mukhlis Khan with, 7,000 soldiers “to teach the lesson” to Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. The mini fortress of Lohgarh was attacked. The Sikhs though small in number, gave a stiff resistance. Guru Sahib and the whole family had to hurriedly move to Chabal, to solemnize the marriage of Bibi Veero Ji (the daughter of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji). The attackers had an upper hand over the Sikhs on the first day of the battle. They looted and plundered all the property and holy residence of Guru Sahib. On the next morning the Sikhs, after consolidating their position, retaliated and made a vigorous attack on the sleeping Mughal forces. Mukhlis Khan, the commander and most of his leading lieutenants were killed. Guru Sahib also suffered a heavy loss of life and property. This was the first armed clash between the Mughals and the Sikhs.

                After this battle, Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji retired to the semi desert wastelands of Bhatinda. (While leaving Amritsar for the Malwa region, Guru Sahib took Guru Granth Sahib with him but after meeting a halt for sometimes at Daroli he sent Guru Granth Sahib to Kartarpur along with the family). Soon after this, a tussle between Guru Sahib and Subedar of Lahore began over the two horses, which were forcibly snatched and taken into custody by the Mughal officials from the two devotees of Guru Sahib, at Lahore. This incident was informed to Guru Sahib. Bhai Bidhi Chand a daring disciple recovered the horses one by one from the royal stable. This dare devil act was considered an open thereat to the authority of the Mughal Empire. The imperial forces (22000 troops) were dispatched towards the Lakhi Jungle under the command of Qamar Beg and Lalla Beg. Guru Hargobind Sahib had only three to four thousand warriors. The Sikh forces under the command of Rai Jodh and Kirt Bhatt camped near a water reservoir. The interception took place near Mehraj and Lahira villages. According to some chronicle (on 16th December 1634) the Sikhs waged a guerilla attack on Mughal forces at night, which resulted heavy causalities in the Mughal camp. The Sikhs routed and defeated the enemy. Guru Sahib lost 1200 Saint Soldiers including Kirt Bhatt Ji and Bhai Jetha Ji. On the other side Sameer Beg and his two sons Shams Beg and Qasim Beg were also killed. The Mughal forces fled to Lahore leaving behind the dead and wounded. The Sikhs did not intercept the fleecing enemy. Guru Sahib built a tank called Gurusar commemorating the victory. Near a village Nathane Guru Sahib faced another encounter with the Mughal forces but remained victorious.

                After these successful encounters Guru Sahib retired at Kartarpur (Jalandhar) along with his warriors. Painda Khan Pathan a commander in Guru’s army and childhood friend, deserted him later and joined the Mughal camp after some altercation with the Sikhs and Guru Sahib on some petty issues. He and Kala Khan (brother of slain Mukhlis Khan), along with imperial army made an attack on Guru Sahib at Kartarpur on 26th April 1635. The Sikhs having a nominal strength of 5000, fought with rare courage and velour. Teg Bahadar Ji (Guru), Baba Gurditta Ji and Bhai Bidhi Chand Ji showed great feasts of bravery. Painda Khan and Kala Khan were killed. Several Sikh Saint Soldiers were also martyred.

                After the battle of Kartarpur, Guru Sahib moved onwards Kiratpur Sahib, which was under the rule of Raja Tara Chand (a hill state chief). Again Guru Sahib’s entourage was suddenly ambushed by a contingent of royal forces under the command of Ahmed Khan in the village Palahi near Phagwara town on 29th April 1635. It caused considerable loss on the Guru’s soldiers. Bhai Dasa Ji and Bhai Sohela Ji (sons of Ballu Bhat, and grandsons of Mula Bhat) sacrificed their lives. Guru Sahib crossed the Sutlej River and reached Kiratpur Sahib where he established another spiritual and preaching center of the Sikh Nation. Here, Guru Sahib spent ten years of his life and breathed his last on Chet Sudhi 5th (6th Chet Samvat 1701) 28th February 1644 (some chronicle record the date as 3rd March, 1644). It is said that when Guru’s body was placed on fire, and as the flames rose high, a large number of Sikhs tried to burn themselves on the funeral pier. Har Rai Sahib (Guru) dissuaded them, but earlier two had jumped into the pier and were consumed by the fire. Before his death Guru Sahib nominated his grandson Har Rai Sahib (The second son of Baba Gurditta Ji) as his successor (Seventh Nanak).
