                  Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the youngest son of Sri Guru Ramdas Ji
                  and Mata Bhani Ji was born at Goindwal Sahib on Vaisakh Vadi
                  7th, (19th Vaisakh) Samvat 1620 (April 15,1563). He learnt
                  Gurmukhi script and Gurbani from Baba Budha ji. He was also
                  given a suitable education in Persian, Hindi and Sanskrit
                  languages. The child (Guru)Arjan Sahib often talked of God and
                  loved to sing His songs. He had two elder brothers, Prithi
                  Chand ji and Mahadev ji. The former proved to be the most
                  selfish and the later mostly preferred utter silence. But
                  (Guru) Arjan Dev Ji was sweet, humble and a perfect blend of
                  devotion and sacrifice. He was hardly 18 years old when his
                  father Sri Guru Ramdas Ji installed him as the Fifth Nanak. He
                  was married to Mata Ganga ji and had a son (Guru) Hargobind
                  Sahib Ji. Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji completed the work on two
                  sacred tanks (Sarovars) Santokhsar and Amritsar. He got the
                  foundation stone of Harmandir Sahib, laid by a Muslim Saint
                  Hazrat Mian Mir Ji of Lahore on 1st Magh, Vikrami Samvat 1644
                  (December 1588). After the completion of Sri Harmandir Sahib,
                  Guru Sahib completed the construction of Santokhsar. Sri Guru
                  Arjan Dev Ji founded the town of Tarn Taran Sahib near
                  Goindwal Sahib and also created a large tank and Gurdwara
                  there. A house for lepers was also built. He also laid the
                  foundation stone of the town Kartarpur in Doaba region (near
                  Jalandhar city). He constructed a Baoli in Dabbi-Bazar of
                  Lahore. (Once Shah Jahan destroyed the Baoli and erected a
                  mosque there. But later on Maharaja Ranjit Singh re-excavated
                  the Baoli. Again, after the partition of India in 1947, it was
                  demolished by the Muslim mob). Guru Sahib also established
                  another town, Hargobindpur on the river Beas and sunk a big
                  well for irrigation at Chheharta, a few miles away from
                  Amritsar.

                  Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji was very energetic and aspiring
                  personality. In order to strengthen the cult of Sikhism he
                  toured far and wide about five years throughout India. He also
                  stayed sometime at Wadali (now it is called Guru-Di-Wadali
                  near Amritsar city). To consolidate and extend Sikhism, Sri
                  Guru Arjan Dev Ji done a great and monumental work. After
                  collecting the hymns of first four Guru Sahibs and several
                  other Hindu and Muslim Saints, and compiled Sri Guru Granth
                  Sahib (written by Bhai Gurdas Ji). Guru Sahib himself
                  contributed about 2000 verses for it, installed it at Sri
                  Harmandir Sahib on Bhadon Sudi 1st Samvat 1661
                  (August/September 1604), and made Baba Budha Ji as the first
                  Granthi. Sri Guru Granth Sahib proved a great landmark in the
                  history of Sikh Nation. It created a sensor of religious
                  separation from the Hindus and the Muslims. Now the Sikhism
                  began to develop as a different religion. Once the emperor
                  Akbar was mislead about the contents of Sri Guru Granth Sahib
                  by the enemies of Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji. But finding nothing
                  objectionable, the emperor Akbar assessed Sri Guru Granth
                  Sahib as “The greatest Granth of synthesis, worthy of
                  reverence”. During the period of Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji the
                  Amritsar city became the central institution where all the
                  Sikhs used to gather annually on Baisakhi and the Massands
                  began to deposit the collected offerings from the different
                  parts of India in Guru Sahib’s treasury.

                <p className="text1">
                  The tradition of Dasvandh and Masand system was also
                  institutionalized. This institution spread the Sikhism to the
                  provinces far distant from the Punjab and attracted a large
                  number of followers. (But the Masand system became rotten with
                  the passage of time Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji abolished it in
                  1698). For the first time the Sikhs began to call Sri Guru
                  Arjan Dev Ji as “Sacha Patshah”. The number of Sikhs began to
                  increase day by day and this made the orthodox Hindus and
                  princely Muslim class more jealous towards Guru Ghar (Sikh
                  Nation). Guru’s elder brother, Prithi Chand made an alliance
                  with Sulhi Khan (a revenue officer), and planned to harm and
                  harass Guru Sahib. But Sulhi Khan died by his sudden fall in a
                  live brick-klins. The orthodox Hindus and the fundamentalist
                  Muslims (Sheikh Ahmed Sirhandi, Birbal and Chandu) were some
                  of the most jealous of Sikh community and Sri Guru Arjan Dev
                  Ji. After the death of Akbar in 1605 both Hindu and Muslim
                  fundamentalists move the new head of state emperor Jahangir
                  against Guru Sahib. Jahangir himself was also jealous about
                  Guru’s propagation of Sikhism. He promptly obliged the enemies
                  of Guru Sahib. Many baseless allegations were leveled against
                  Guru Sahib, one of those was helping the rebellious Khusro.
                  Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji was arrested and brought to Lahore where
                  he was charge- sheeted and implicated in the false cases. The
                  Governor of Lahore was assigned the task of the execution. He
                  handed over Guru Sahib over to Chandu, a petty businessman and
                  an orthodox Hindu of Lahore city. He tortured Guru Sahib about
                  three days in a manner unknown in the history of mankind. It
                  is said that Mian Mir (a Muslim Sufi Saint and friend of Guru
                  Sahib) tried to intercede on behalf of Guru Sahib but the
                  later forbade him. During the torturing period, Guru Sahib was
                  made to sit on the hot iron plates and burning sand was poured
                  over his naked body. When his body was blistered, he was
                  chained and thrown into the river Ravi. Thus Guru Sahib
                  embraced martyrdom on Jeth Sudi 4th (1st Harh) Samvat 1663,
                  (May 30, 1606) Jahangir in his autobiography acknowledges that
                  he personally ordered the execution of Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji.
                  The martyrdom of Guru Sahib changed the entire character of
                  Sikhism radically. The Sikh Nation naturally looked upon this
                  as the bigotry and cruelty of the theist Muslim state and the
                  orthodox Hindus towards the newly born, peace loving Sikhism.
