                  Sri Guru Amardas Ji, the Third Nanak was born at village
                  Basarke Gillan in Amritsar district on Vaisakh Sudi 14th, (8th
                  Jeth), Samvat 1536 (5th May 1479). (Some chronicles mention
                  the month of April 1479). His father Tej Bhan Bhalla and
                  mother Bakht Kaur (also referred as Sulakhni and Lakhmi Devi)
                  were orthodox Hindus and used to pay annual visits to the
                  Ganges river at Haridwar. Sri Guru Amardas Ji was married to
                  Mata Mansa Devi ji and had four children: two daughters; Bibi
                  Dani ji and Bibi Bhani ji (she was married to Sri Guru Ramdass
                  Ji), and two sons; Mohan ji and Mohri ji.

                <p className="text1">
                  Once Sri Guru Amardas Ji heard some hymns of Sri Guru Nanak
                  Dev Ji from Bibi Amro Ji, the daughter of Sri Guru Angad Dev
                  Ji. He became too much impressed and immediately went to see
                  Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji at Khadur Sahib. Under the impact of the
                  teachings of Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji, Sri Guru Amardas Ji
                  adopted him as his spiritual guide (Guru). Then he started
                  living at Khadur Sahib. He used to rise early in the morning,
                  bring water from the Beas River for Guru’s bath and fetch wood
                  from the Jungle for ‘Guru ka Langar’.

                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji appointed Sri Guru Amardas Ji as third
                  Nanak in March 1552 at the age of 73. This was a result of his
                  services and devotion to Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji and his
                  teachings. He established his headquarters at newly built town
                  Goindwal. There he propagated the Sikh faith in a very planned
                  manner. He divided the Sikh Sangat area into 22 preaching
                  centres. (Manjis), each under the charge of a devout Sikh. He
                  himself visited and sent Sikh missionaries to different parts
                  of India to spread Sikhism. He strengthened the tradition of
                  ‘Guru ka Langer’ and made it compulsory for the visitor to the
                  Guru saying that ‘Pehle Pangat Phir Sangat’. Once the emperor
                  Akbar came to see Guru Sahib and he had to eat the coarse rice
                  in the Langar before he could have an interview with Guru
                  Sahib. He was too much impressed from this system and
                  expressed his desire to grant some royal property for ‘Guru ka
                  Langar’, but Guru Sahib declined it with respect. Sri Guru
                  Amardas Ji persuaded Akbar to waive off toll-tax (pilgrim’s
                  tax) for non-Muslims while crossing Yamuna and Ganga, Akbar
                  did so. Sri Guru Amardas Ji maintained cordial relations with
                  emperor Akbar. He preached against Sati and advocated
                  widow-remarriage. He asked the women to discard ‘Purdah’
                  (veil). He introduced new birth, marriage and death
                  ceremonies. Thus he created a fence around the infant like
                  Sikhism and there upon met stiff resistance from the Orthodox
                  Hindus and Muslim fundamentalists. He fixed three Gurpurbs for
                  Sikh celebrations: Diwali, Vaisakhi and Maghi. Visiting of
                  Hindu pilgrimage centres and paying tributes to the Muslim
                  places where prohibited. Sri Guru Amardas Ji constructed Baoli
                  at Goindwal Sahib having eighty-four steps and made it a Sikh
                  pilgrimage centre for the first time in the history of
                  Sikhism. He reproduced more copies of the hymns of Sri Guru
                  Nanak Dev Ji and Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji. He also composed 869
                  (according to some chronicles these were 709) verses (stanzas)
                  including Anand Sahib, and Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji made all the
                  Shabads part of Guru Granth Sahib. Sri Guru Amardas Ji did not
                  consider anyone of his sons fit for Guruship and chose instead
                  his son-in law (Guru) Ramdas Ji to succeed him. Certainly it
                  was practically a right step not as emotional, because Bibi
                  Bhani ji and Guru Ramdas Sahib had true spirit of service and
                  their keen understanding of the Sikh principles deserved this.
                  This practice shows that Guruship could be transferred to any
                  body fit for the Sikh cause and not to the particular person
                  who belonged to the same family or of other. Sri Guru Amardas
                  Ji at the ripe age of 95 passed away for heaven on Bhadon Sudi
                  14th, (1st Assu) Samvat 1631, (September 1, 1574) at Goindwal
                  Sahib near District Amritsar, after giving responsibility of
                  Guruship to the Fourth Nanak, Sri Guru Ramdas Ji.
