                  Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, before his departure for heavenly
                  abode, nominated his grand son, Har Rai Ji at the tender age
                  of 14, as his successor (Seventh Nanak), on 3rd March, 1644.
                  Sri Guru Har Rai Ji was the son of Baba Gurditta Ji and Mata
                  Nihal Kaur Ji(also known as Mata Ananti Ji). Sri Guru Har Rai
                  Ji married to Mata Kishan Kaur Ji(Sulakhni Ji) daughter of Sri
                  Daya Ram Ji of Anoopshahr (Bulandshahr) in Uttar Pradesh on
                  Har Sudi 3, Samvat 1697. Guru Har Rai Sahib had two sons: Sri
                  Ram Rai Ji and Sri Har Krishan Sahib Ji(Guru). Sri Guru Har
                  Rai Ji was a man of peace but he never disbanded or discharged
                  the armed Sikh Warriors(Saint Soldiers), who earlier were
                  maintained by his grandfather (Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji).
                  He otherwise further boosted the military spirit of the Sikhs.
                  But he never himself indulged in any direct political and
                  armed controversy with the contemporary Mughal Empire. Once on
                  the request of Dara Shikoh (the eldest son of emperor
                  Shahjahan). Guru Sahib helped him to escape safely from the
                  bloody hands of Aurangzeb's armed forces during the war of
                  succession.

                  Once Guru Sahib was coming back from the tour of Malwa and
                  Doaba regions, Mohamad Yarbeg Khan, (son of Mukhlis Khan, who
                  was killed by Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji in a battle)
                  attacked the kafla of Guru Sahib with the force of one
                  thousand armed men. The unwarranted attack was repulsed by a
                  few hundred Saint Soldiers of Guru Sahib with great courage
                  and bravery. The enemy suffered a heavy loss of life and fled
                  the scene. This self-defense measure, (a befitting reply to
                  the unwarranted armed attack of the privileged muslims), was
                  an example for those who professed the theory of so called
                  nonviolence or “Ahimsa Parmo Dharma”. Guru Sahib often awarded
                  various Sikh warriors with gallantry awards.
                </p>
                <p className="text1">
                  Guru Sahib also established an Aurvedic herbal medicine
                  hospital and a research centre at Kiratpur Sahib. There, he
                  maintained a zoo also. Once Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of
                  Shah Jahan fell seriously ill by some unknown disease. The
                  best physicians available in the country and abroad were
                  consulted, but there was no improvement. At last the emperor
                  made a humble request to Guru Sahib for the treatment of his
                  son. Guru Sahib accepting the request, handed over some rare
                  and suitable medicines to the messenger of the emperor. The
                  life of Dara Shikoh was saved from the cruel jaws of death.
                  The emperor, whole heartily thanked and wanted to grant some
                  “Jagir”, but Guru Sahib never accepted.

                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Har Rai Ji also visited Lahore, Sialkot, Pathankot,
                  Samba, Ramgarh and many places of Jammu and Kashmir region. He
                  established 360 Sikh missionary seats (ManJis). He also tried
                  to improve the old corrupt Masand system and appointed pious
                  and committed personalities like Suthre Shah, Sahiba, Sangtia,
                  Mian Sahib, Bhagat Bhagwan, Bhagat Mal and Jeet Mal Bhagat
                  (also known as Bairagi), as the heads of ManJis.

                <p className="text1">
                  Sri Guru Har Rai Ji faced some serious difficulties during the
                  period of his guruship. The corrupt masands, Dhir Mals and
                  Minas always tried to preclude the advancement of Sikh
                  religion. After the death of Shah Jahan, the attitude of the
                  state headed by Aurangzeb towards the non-muslims, turned
                  hostile.
                </p>
                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  The emperor Aurangzeb made an excuse for the help rendered to
                  prince Dara Shikoh by Guru Sahib during the war of succession
                  and framed false charges against Guru Sahib and was summoned
                  to Delhi. Ram Rai Ji appeared on behalf of Guru Sahib in the
                  court. He tried to clarify some misunderstandings regarding
                  Guru Ghar and Sikh faith, created by Dhirmals and Minas. Yet
                  another trap, which he could not escape, was to clarify the
                  meaning of the verse “The Ashes of the Mohammedan fall into
                  the potter’s clot, It is molded into pots and bricks, and they
                  cry out as they burn”. Ram Rai, in order to please the emperor
                  and gain more sympathy replied that the text had been
                  needlessly corrupted by some ignorant person and inserted the
                  word Musleman instead of word Beiman (dishonest). (The actual
                  meaning of the verse is that the human soul is not bound to
                  the physical structure or the body of a person. The physical
                  material of the bodies of both Hindus and Muselmans face the
                  same fate and it is a universal truth. The soul leaves the
                  body immediately after the death and it does not remain in the
                  grave waiting for doom’s day. And the earth consumes the
                  body-material in due course of time) It is a rational and
                  scientific view of Sikhism.
                </p>
                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  When Sri Guru Har Rai Ji was informed about this incident, he
                  immediately excommunicated Ram Rai Ji from the Sikh Panth and
                  never met him, through the later pleaded repeatedly for
                  forgiveness. Thus Guru Sahib established a strict property for
                  the Sikhs against any alteration of original verse in Guru
                  Granth Sahib and the basic conventions set up by Guru Nanak
                  Sahib.

                <p className="text1 mb-3">
                  Knowing that the end was near, Sri Guru Har Rai Ji installed
                  his younger son Har Krishna as the Eighth Nanak and passed
                  away on Kartik Vadi 9 (5 Kartik), Bikrami Samvat 1718, (6th
                  October, 1661) at Kiratpur Sahib.
