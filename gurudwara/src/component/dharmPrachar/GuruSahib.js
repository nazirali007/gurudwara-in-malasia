                  Sri Guru Nanak D ev Ji (the First Nanak, the founder of
                  Sikhism) was born on 15th April, 1469 at Rai-Bhoi-di Talwandi
                  in the present distrect of Shekhupura (Pakistan), now Nanakana
                  Sahib. The Birthday of Guru Nanak Sahib is celebrated on 15th
                  Kartik Puranmashi i.e. full moon day of the month Kartik. On
                  this day the Birthday of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji is celebrated
                  every year. (But some other chronicals state that Sri Guru
                  Nanak Dev Ji was born on 20th October,1469) Guru Nanak’s
                  father, Mehta Kalyan Das, more popularly known as Mehta Kalu
                  was the agent and Chief Accountant of Rai Bular. Sri Guru
                  Nanak Dev Ji ‘s mother was Mata Tripta, a simple, pious and
                  extremely religious woman. Nanak had an elder sister, Nanki,
                  who always cherished her younger brother.

                  Nanak was an extra-ordinary and different child in many ways.
                  God provided him with contemplative mind and rational
                  thinking. At the age of seven, he learnt Hindi and Sanskrit.
                  He surprised his teachers with the sublimity of his
                  extra-ordinary knowledge about divine things. At the age of
                  thirteen, he learned Persian and Sanskrit and at the age of
                  16, he was the most learned young man in the region. He was
                  married to Mata Sulakhni ji, who gave birth to two sons: Sri
                  Chand and Lakhmi Das. In November 1504, Sri Guru Nanak Dev
                  Ji’s elder sister Nanaki ji took him to Sultanpurlodhi where
                  her husband Jai Ram ji got him the Job of storekeeper in the
                  Modikhana of the local Nawab, Daulat Khan Lodhi.

                  At the age of 38, in August 1507, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji heard
                  God ‘s call to dedicate himself to the service of humanity
                  after bathing in “Vain Nadi” (a small river) Near Sultanpur
                  Lodhi. The very first sentence which he ‘ uttered then was, ”
                  There is no Hindu, no Musalman”. He now undertook long travels
                  to preach his unique and divine doctrine (Sikhism). After
                  visiting different places in Punjab, he decided to proceed on
                  four long tours covering different religious places in India
                  and abroad. These tours are called Char Udasis of Guru Nanak
                  Sahib. During the four journeys, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji visited
                  different religious places preaching Sikhism. He went to
                  Kurukshetra, Haridwar, Joshi Math, Ratha Sahib, Gorakh Matta
                  (Nanak Matta), Audhya, Prayag, Varanasi, Gaya, Patna, Dhubri
                  and Gauhati in Assam, Dacca, Puri, Cuttock, Rameshwaram,
                  Ceylon, Bidar, Baroach, Somnath, Dwarka, Janagarh, Ujjain,
                  Ajmer, Mathura, Pakpattan, Talwandi, Lahore, Sultanpur,
                  Bilaspur, Rawalsar, Jawalaji, Spiti Vally, Tibet, Ladakh,
                  Kargil, Amarnath, Srinagar and Baramula. Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji
                  also paid visit to Muslim holy places. In this regard he went
                  to Mecca, Medina, Beghdad via Multan, Peshawar Sakhar, Son
                  Miani, Hinglaj etc. Some accounts say that Guru Sahib reached
                  Mecca by sea-route. Guru Sahib also visited Syra, Turkey and
                  Tehran (the present capital of Iran). From Tehran Guru Sahib
                  set out on the caravan route and covered Kabul, Kandhar and
                  Jalalabad. The real aim of the tour was awakening the people
                  to realise the truth about God and to introduce Sikhism. He
                  established a network of preaching centres of Sikhism which
                  were called “Manjis”. He appointed able and committed
                  followers as its head (preacher of Sikhism). The basic tenents
                  of Sikhism were wilfully conceived by the people from all
                  walks of life. The seeds of Sikhism were sown all over India
                  and abroad in well-planned manner.

                  In the year 1520, Babar attacked India. His troops slaughtered
                  thousands of innocent civilians of all walks of life. Women
                  and children were made captives and all their property looted
                  at Amiabad. Guru Nanak Sahib challenged this act of barbarity
                  in strong words. He was arrested and released, shortly after
                  making Babar realising his blunder. All the prisoners were
                  also released.

                  Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji settled down at Kartarpur city (now in
                  Pakistan) which was founded by him in 1522 and spent the rest
                  of his life there (1522-1539). There was daily Kirtan and the
                  institution of Langar (free kitchen) was introduced. Knowing
                  that the end was drawing near, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, after
                  testing his two sons and some followers, installed Bhai Lehna
                  ji (Guru Angad Dev Ji) as the Second Nanak in 1539, and after
                  a few days passed into Sachkhand on 22nd September, 1539. Thus
                  ended the wordly journey of this god-gifted Master (Guru) of
                  mankind. He rejected the path of renunciation Tyaga or Yoga,
                  the authority of the Vedas and the Hindu caste system. Sri
                  Guru Nanak Dev Ji emphasised the leading of householder’s life
                  (Grista), unattached to gross materialism. The services of
                  mankind Sewa, Kirtan, Satsang and faith in ‘One’ Omnipotent
                  God are the basic concepts of Sikhism established by Sri Guru
                  Nanak Dev Ji. Thus he laid the foundations of Sikhism. He
                  preached new idea of God as Supreme, Universal, All-powerful
                  and truthful. God is Formless (Nirankar), the Sole, the
                  Creator, the self-existent, the Incomprehensible and the
                  Ever-lasting and the creator of all things (Karta Purakh). God
                  is infinite, All knowing, True, All-giver, Nirvair, and
                  Omnipotent. He is Satnam, the Eternal and Absolute Truth.

                  As a social reformer Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji upheld the cause of
                  women, downtrodden and the poors. He attacked the citadel of
                  caste system of Hindus and theocracy of Muslim rulers. He was
                  a born poet. He wrote 974 hyms comprising Japji Sahib, Asa-
                  Di-Var, Bara-Mah, Sidh-Gosht, Onkar (Dakhani) and these were
                  included in Sri Guru Granth Sahib by Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji. He
                  was also a perfect musician. He with the company of Bhai
                  Mardana compsed such tunes in various Indian classNameical
                  Ragas that charmed and tawed wild creatures like Babar,
                  subdued saging kings, raved bigots and tyrants, made thugs and
                  robbers saints. He was a reformer as well as a revolutionary.
                  God had endowed him with a contemplative mind and pious
                  disposition. Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji called him “the image of
                  God, nay, God Himself”.
