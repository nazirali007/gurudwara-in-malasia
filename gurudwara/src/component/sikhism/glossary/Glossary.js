            <b id="akali">Akali</b>
            <p >
              Its dictionary meaning is, a worshipper of Akal i.e. the Timeless
              God. Originally, the Akalis were the death-squads of the Sikhs,
              who spearheaded the task of toppling down the ‘Mughals and
              Pathans’ political hegemony in the North West of India, according
              to the programme given to Banda Singh Bahadur by Guru Gobind Singh
              in the year 1708 A. D. Ever Since, these Akalis have been in the
              vanguard of the Sikh struggle against tyranny and foreign rule and
              during the Sikh Raj in the Punjab, the Akalis were the custodians
              of the Seat of Spiritual Sikh Authority, the Akal Takht at
              Amritsar. These Akalis, the most famous of whom was General Phula
              Singh, rendered most conspicuous service in establishing Sikh
              Power up to the Khyber Pass, but they never recognised the
              political jurisdiction of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the King and
              always upheld the banner of the supremacy of the mystic Sikh
              Panth, in all matters, spiritual or political. Maharaja Ranjit
              Singh was diplomatic enough, not to challenge this legitimate
              claim of the Akalis, and on one occasion submissively accepted
              corporal punishment awarded to him at the Akal Takht, Amritsar for
              a sex- scandal involving breach of the discipline of the Khalsa.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the year 1922 and afterwards, those who came forward to
              organize themselves into bands of volunteers to rescue the Sikhs’
              Holy shrines from the management of the hereditary priests, who
              were backed by the British Government, labeled themselves as
              Akalis and when these well-endowed historical holy shrines passed
              under the statutory management of elected Sikh representatives,
              these Akalis captured the management bodies and ever since have
              maintained their position as the managers of the Sikh Gurdwaras as
              well as the true spokesmen of Sikh political ideas and
              aspirations. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee holds
              sway over the important Sikh Gurdwaras, while the Shiromani Akali
              Dal which is merely another side of the medal reigns supreme as
              the political spokesman of the Sikhs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In current political parlance an Akali is one who holds the view
              that the management of the Sikh religious institutions must remain
              outside the control and influence of the Government in power
              whether in Punjab or at Delhi and who demands that in the North of
              India there should be a region where the Sikh voice is accorded a
              special political importance and who further acclaim that politics
              must not be wholly divorced from the postulates of religion.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whatever the external dissensions and the fratricidal conflicts
              amongst these Akali organizations, these three aims and objectives
              remain as unchanging foundations of the Akali politics and mode of
              thought.
            </p>

            <b id="guru-granth-sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</b>
            <p>
              More appropriately, Guru Granth Sahib, that is the Book of the
              Gurus, or the sacred Book which has the status of the last and
              final Sikh Prophet. It is the Sikh scripture containing hymns and
              revelations of the Sikh Gurus and some others who preceded the
              Sikh Gurus or were contemporary with them, prefiguring the glad
              tidings of the Spirit which manifested itself in the form of the
              Sikh religion. After the passing away of the Tenth Guru, Guru
              Gobind Singh, the status of the successor in the line of the Sikh
              prophets was conferred on this Sikh Scripture which now invariably
              occupies the central place of prominence in all places of Sikh
              worship
            </p>

            <b id="nihang">Nihang</b>
            <p>
              Nihang, literally, is an alligator, who is all supreme in the
              waters, just as the lion is the supreme king amongst the fauna of
              the forest. Nihang, in Sikh terminology, is a synonym for an
              Akali, just equivalent to a staunch Sikh. The Nihangs trace their
              origin from a son of Guru Gobind Singh whom Guru Gobind Singh
              robed with a blue battle-dress with his own hands and a Nihang is,
              therefore, invariably in blue clothes.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Nihangs, and Akalis were identical till the middle of the
              19th century when the Sikh political supremacy was extinguished in
              the Punjab and ever since two bands of Nihangs have continued to
              exist under license from the Government of the day with the right
              to roam about in military formations, in free possession of their
              customary steel weapons of the 19th century, including the right
              to possess and retain a few old cannons, which are more symbolic
              than battle-worthy. These Nihangs have their headquarters at
              Damdama Sahib, a holy Sikh shrine in the Bhatinda District of the
              present Punjab and they claim that they are keeping themselves
              alert and ready for the day when the Khalsa will regain its
              political power and glory.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the last 25 years, in a free India an irate bureaucracy
              have proceeded to annihilate small bands of Nihangs by mowing them
              down with rifle and machine gun, at the slightest pretexts,
              presumably to communicate unmistakably to the Sikhs, the
              omnipotent character of the new power in a free India.
            </p>

            <b id="granthi">Granthi</b>
            <p>
              Literally, ‘the keeper and the reader of the Sikh scripture.1 In
              every Sikh Gurdwara there is a granthi nominated or accepted as
              such by the local Sikh congrega-tion. His duty is to keep and
              manage the Gurdwara and to run its religious services, but he is
              not an ordained priest vested with the exclusive competence of
              performing or controlling Sikh worship in a Gurdwara. There is no
              priesthood recognised in Sikhism and the granthi is thus merely a
              functionary of the Sikh congregation enjoying no special rights or
              status.
            </p>

            <b id="panth">Panth</b>

            <p>
              Panth, literally means, The way, the good way of life. In the
              famous, sub-chapter of Mahabharat, called, Yaksaprasna the
              question is posed and answered as to what does the term, Panth
              mean. The answer supplied is, “The Panth is the path which all
              good men in the past have invariably trodden.”, mahajana yena
              gatah sah panthah. In the current religious terminology, the word
              Panth stands for the Sikh religion as well as the invisible mystic
              body of those who profess it and who thus represent the Will of
              God on Earth. It is to this Panth that all true Sikhs owe their
              allegiance and it is in the name of this Panth that a true Sikh is
              expected to sacrifice his all on this earth. It is in the name of
              this Panth that the Sikh political party, the Shiromani Akali Dal
              fights its elections and runs other political campaigns.
            </p>

            <p>
              This political concept of the Panth sharply distinguishes it from
              the current political convictions that hold that economic activity
              and considerations are the sole concern and aim of politics. The
              concept of Panth joins issues with the contemporary political mode
              of thinking and asserts that the true concern of politics is the
              ethical and spiritual evolution and life of man in an organized
              society.
            </p>

            <b id="sadh-sangat">Sadh Sangat</b>

            <p>
              Literally, ‘the congregation of the good people’. In Sikh parlance
              it means the Sikh congregation composed of such Sikh believers who
              are known to be poised and steadfast in the Panth. The founder of
              the Sikh religion had declared the Sadh Sangat and the Sikh
              Testament as the only twin ‘miracles’ vouchsafed to the Sikh
              religion by God for revitalizing and transforming the human
              society and ever since the Sadh Sangat or the congregation of
              those well-established in the Sikh faith has been treated with a
              great deal of reverence and invested with much power in relation
              to matters concerning the Sikhs and their religion.
            </p>

            <b id="sant">Sant</b>
            <p>
              Sant is the synonym for, ‘the saint’. A saint or sant is a holy
              man clothed with the power of the numenon. The term sant occurs
              frequently in the ancient Pali literature of Bud-dhism from where
              it seems to have been resuscitated during the middle ages in India
              when the Bhakti Movement took birth. Through the Bhakti Movement,
              this term has come to be incorporated in the Sikh sacred
              literature. In the Guru Granth there is frequent mention of the
              status and significance of a sant, a holy man, who represents the
              salt of the earth and the hope of mankind. Out of this background
              has sprung a class of pseudo-sants amongst the Sikhs in recent
              years that claim holiness in the terms of the Fundamental
              teachings of Sikhism and thus have acquired much influence in the
              countryside where Sikh masses predominate.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Sant are mostly illiterate or uneducated, according to the
              ancient prejudice that holiness accords ill with worldly learning
              and scholastic education. As a consequence, this class of the
              sants amongst the Sikhs is more conspicuous for fraud and
              chicanery rather than piety and capacity to guide individuals and
              direct the society towards ethical goals.
            </p>

            <b id="giani">Giani</b>
            <p>
              Sanskrit, jnani, a term which goes back to the ancient upanishadas
              and the Bhagwad Glta, where it stands for, a man of gnosis, one
              who has achieved the supreme realization. He is thus spoken of as
              ‘one with God1 and it is this term which has been inducted into
              the Sikh Scripture and the Sikh usage. It stands, originally, for
              a Sikh who has achieved a mastery over the understanding of the
              Sikh doctrines and has practiced these doctrines in his life to
              achieve complete realization of their inner truths. One who can
              expound the Sikh scripture properly is also referred to as a
              giani. During the recent years the term has been considerably
              devalued, both literally as well as on the political level. The
              Universities in the Punjab confer the academic Degree of Gyani on
              any person who passes through a cheap examination in Punjabi
              Language and literature, not necessarily the Sikh scripture, and
              in the post-Independence era, a Sikh is contemptuously referred to
              as a giani by the non-Sikhs with the twin object of denigrating
              him, as well as avoiding the formal courtesy of addressing him as
              a Sardar–the courtesy-title reminiscent of a period when the Sikhs
              were the rulers in this part of India.
            </p>

            <b id="jathedar">Jathedar</b>

            <p>
              Literally, jathedar means, ‘a captain’. In Sikh parlance it means
              a Chief of a band of Sikh volunteers who have enrolled themselves
              into a unit for whole time service in the cause of the Panth, or
              Sikh objectives. This term gained fresh prominence during the
              Akali movement for gaining control of the Sikh gurdwaras during
              the twenties of this century when a large number of Sikh bands
              organized themselves to wrest the control of the Sikh holy shrines
              from the hereditary priestly classes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, a jathedar remains a local political boss in Sikh politics
              owing his allegiance to the Shiromani Akali Dal which might be one
              or more than one organisation, each claiming itself as the true
              and genuine spokesman for the Sikh causes.
            </p>

            <b id="singh-sabha">Singh Sabha</b>
            <p>
              During the third quarter of the 19th century, the Sikhs ultimately
              came to the bitter conclusion that they cannot oust the British
              Power from their homeland, the Punjab, since neither the Hindus
              nor the Muslims would join them in doing so and the Sikhs,
              therefore, turned their face towards the roots of their religious
              faith. It was in this background that they invited a Hindu
              demagogue from Maharashtra, Swami Daya Nand, to preach against
              idolatry amongst Hindus. Swami Daya Nand, who had failed to strike
              roots in any other part of India readily accepted this invitation
              and he was warmly welcomed and aided by the Sikhs to establish
              Arya Samaj societies in the Punjab with the object of purifying
              Hindu society of idolatry and other superstitions so that it may
              regain its pristine spiritual vigor and thus become a natural and
              ultimate ally of Sikhism. As it happened, however, the Arya Samaj
              Organisation and Swami Daya Nand, both passed into the hands of an
              element of Punjabi Hindus whose primary motivation was the hatred
              and opposition to Sikhism and not reversion to the original roots
              of Hinduism. In this manner the Arya Samaj movement became
              primarily a virulently anti-Sikh movement obliging its Sikh
              founders and office holders to quit it. Thus a positive Sikh
              religious reform movement came into existence, called the Singh
              Sabha Movement. The originators and founders of Singh Sabha
              movement were precisely those Sikhs who had invited Swami Daya
              Nand to Punjab and who had fostered the Arya Samaj Societies to
              begin with. In the year 1873, the First Central Singh Sabha
              organisation was - established at Amritsar under the chairmanship
              of Sardar Thakur Singh Sandhawalia, with Giani Gian Singh, the
              famous Sikh scholar as its secretary. In the year 1879, a rival
              Singh Saba Central Organisation was established at Lahore with
              Professor Gurmukh Singh of the Oriental College as its secretary
              and in the year 1880 both these central organisations merged into
              one. The clarion call of the Singh Sabha Movement was, ‘back to
              the original purity of Sikhism’ and to achieve this objective, a
              large number of social and religious reforms were affected. The
              Singh Sabha Movement remained vigorous for about half a century
              when under the impact of political upheaval in the rest of the
              country, the Sikh ethos were transformed into political yearnings.
              This change in Sikh attitude became reflected in the Akali
              Movement with the twin object of purifying Sikh practices and of
              ousting the foreign political power from India Currently, an
              influential committee has been set up by the Shiromani Gurdwara
              Parbandhak Committee to celebrate the Centenary of the Singh Sabha
              Movement as well as to revive the pristine purity of Sikh
              practices.
            </p>

            <b id="morcha">Morcha</b>

            <p>
              Morcha literally means, a battlefront, and in the current parlance
              of political struggle, particularly amongst the Sikhs, an issue of
              confrontation with the Government. Whenever the Sikh people are
              persuaded that the Government of the day is acting in a manner
              which is basically hostile to the fundamental Sikh interests, they
              create or seek for a situation in which the Government has to
              enforce its statutory laws by penalizing the Sikhs. Thus, a
              situation develops in which bands of Sikhs come forth to undergo
              penalties of the law with a view to assert the supremacy of their
              own meta legal fundamental interests. Such a confrontation is
              given the name of a morcha.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term has now traveled even into the non-Sikh circles where
              similar situations are named as morchas by the parties contending
              against the Government of the day on a particular issue.
            </p>

            <b id="sardar">Sardar</b>

            <p>
              It is a Persian word which means the elite, or one belonging to
              the ruling race. The Pathans and Mughals who had become the ruling
              races in India for several hundred years were referred to as
              Sardars, when by the dose of the 17th century, the Tenth Sikh Guru
              founded the Order of the Khalsa and one each member of this Order,
              he conferred the title of Sardar. During the 18th century, the
              Sikhs succeeded in wresting the political power from the hands of
              the Pathans and Mughals in the entire region of the North Western
              India and thus became de facto Sardars also in addition to de jure
              Sardars. Ever since, a Sikh has been addressed as a Sardar by way
              of courtesy during the British period by the Government
              authorities as well as by his own non-Sikh compatriots and
              neighbours. After India became free in 1947, a set policy has been
              adopted to discourage the use of this courtesy title in relation
              to a Sikh and a Sikh is now invariably referred to as a Shri in
              official phraseology and as a giani, when not something worse, by
              his neighbours and co-citizens of a free India.

            <b id="akal-takht">Akal Takht</b>

            <p>
              It is one and primary seat of Sikh Authority out of all Takhts or
              thrones situated in various parts of India. Akal Takht is situated
              in front of the famous Golden Temple at Amritsar and it was
              established by the 6th Guru, Hargobind (1595-1644) in the year
              1609 A. D. when the Sikh religion made a formal bid to proclaim
              its basic commitment to politics and social problems. The other
              three Takhts are situated at Anandpur Sahib in the Siwalik
              foothills of Himalayas, at Patna Sahib in Eastern India and at
              Nanded in Southern India. The building of Akal Takht Comprises of
              a high throne of an altitude three times as high as was permitted
              to any authority by the Mughal sovereigns of India and it is
              higher than the Mughal Throne balcony in the Red Fort at Delhi.
              Thus, Guru Hargobind, by establishing the Akal Takht and building
              this high throne openly repudiated the Mughal sovereignty over
              India and proclaimed the Sikh claim to a co-equal sovereign
              status. During the 18th and 19th and even 20th centuries the Sikh
              people have occasionally assembled at the Akal Takht to make
              national political decisions through consensus which have been
              deemed as binding on every Sikh. Many of these decisions have been
              of the nature of an open revolt against the established political
              authority in the country. The Akal Takht and the other seats of
              Sikh Authority, are in theory, managed and controlled by a
              Jathedar or Controller General and during the Sikh Raj even
              Maharaja Ranjit Singh was obliged to submit himself to its
              decisions.

            <p>
              Literally, mahant means, the headman, and in Hindu usage a mahant
              means the manager of a well-established temple. Amongst the Sikhs,
              a mahant stands or stood for the manager of a Sikh gurdwara since
              most of the historical Sikh shrines had remained under the
              management of such Sikh recluses who did not observe the outward
              symbols of Sikhism and thus remained safe from the Mughal
              Persecution. With the destruction of the Sikh power in Punjab in
              the middle of the 19th century, these mahants became arbitrarily
              powerful as they came to be protected by the civil laws of a
              non-Sikh power, the British, in their possession as the hereditary
              controllers of the properties of the Sikh historical shrines.
              Gradually they lapsed into many Hindu and non-Sikh practices and
              adopted even anti-Sikh postures, backed as they were by the
              British bureaucracy. One such mahant was Narain Dass, who in the
              year 1921 massacred about 150 Sikh pilgrims within the precincts
              of the Sikh shrine commemorating the birthplace of the founder of
              Sikhism, Nankana Sahib, and this tragedy triggered off the Sikh
              upsurge, called the Akali movement which openly defied the mahants
              of the affluent Sikh shrines as well as the British bureaucracy
              backing them. After a struggle of about half a dozen years, the
              Sikhs succeeded in wresting the control of most of these shrines
              from the hands of these mahants and a statutory management
              committee called, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee was
              set up to control these shrines.

            <p>
              As has been explained with reference to the term Singh Sabha many
              central organisations were set up for the purpose of reviving the
              pristine purity of the Sikh faith and practices and in the year
              1883 when these central organisations had merged into one
              organisation, the Singh Sabha of Amritsar adopted the name of the
              Khalsa Diwan for itself. Baba Sir Khem Singh Bedi was the first
              President of this Khalsa Diwan and Bhai Gurmukh Singh was its
              Secretary. A few years later, grave differences arose amongst the
              members of the Khalsa Diwan as to the attitude to be adopted in
              the appraisal of the original forms of Hinduism, called Sanatan
              Dharma, but in its primary objective the Khalsa Diwan stuck to the
              original objective of the Singh Sabha Movement. This Khalsa Diwan
              ultimately became transformed into the Chief Khalsa Diwan which
              till a few years ago remained as the Central Organisation of the
              Sikh feudal chiefs.
