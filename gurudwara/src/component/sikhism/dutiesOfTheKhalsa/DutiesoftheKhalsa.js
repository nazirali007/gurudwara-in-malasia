          <p>
            In one of his poems, Guru Gobind Singh Sahib defines the Khalsa :
          </p>

          <p>“He who repeats night and day the name of Him,</p>
          <p>Who has full love and confidence in God,</p>
          <p>Who bestows not a thought on anv but one God,</p>
          <p>Whose enduring light is inextinguishable,</p>
          <p>
            Who puts no faith in fasting and worshipping cemeteries and
            monasteries,
          </p>
          <p>
            Who only recognises the one God and makes no fetish, Of pilgrimages,
          </p>
          <p>alms, charities and austerities:</p>
          <p>He is recognised as a true member of the Khalsa,</p>
          <p>In whose heart the light of the Perfect One shines.”</p>

          <p>
            Guru Gobind Singh Sahib laid down the following duties for the
            Khalsa :
          </p>
          <p>
            The Khalsa is to worship one God and read Nitnem (Five Banis) and
            daily meditate on the Name.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is to keep the symbols (Panj Kakar) and to lead his life
            according to the Guru’s teaching. Gurmantra is Waheguru and the
            Basic creed is Mool-mantra.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has no caste after joining the brotherhood ; he has to repudiate
            non-Sikh rites and ceremonies, and follow only Sikh practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is not to commit ‘any of the four misdeeds (Kurahat) namely, the
            shaving or cutting of hair, eating Halal meat, adultery and the use
            of tobacco or any other intoxicant.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is not to commit any of the social offences (Tankhah), such as
            giving dowry, using liquors and intoxicants, raising monuments over
            graves and associating with apostates.
          </p>
          <p>He is to serve the sangat in all ways</p>
          <p>He must practice arms and be ready defend the weak.</p>
          <p>
            The Khalsa was a saint-soldier wedded to the two-fold ideal of
            Bhagti and Shakti. He was to combine self-respect with humility.Guru
            Gobind Singh Sahib though a creator of the Khalsa regarded himself
            as their servent . He says, ” To serve them pleases me the most; no
            other service is so dear to my soul.” Like a loving father, he was
            prepared to forgive the sudden lapses of the Khalsa as in the case
            of the “Forty Immortals”, whom he claimed as his own in the nick of
            time. The Khalsa was given a position equal to that of the Guru. The
            Guru consists of two parts : the body and the Name. The Guru
            nominated the Khalsa, as his body and Guru Granth Sahib as the
            embodiment the Name. That is why we use the title of Guru-Khalsa.
            The Guru acknowledged his debt to the Khalsa in one of his verses.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It is through them that I have gained experience ; with their help
            I have subdued my enemies. Through their favour, I am exalted,
            otherwise there are millions of ordinary humble men like me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Meaning of Symbols: Symbols or outward signs are a mode of
            discipline. A person who enters the Panth (Khalsa Community) will
            gladly embrace all its tenets and symbols. Symbols test the
            disciple’s firmness and strength of faith. They indicate the type of
            character the wearer should have. He must be proud of being a Sikh,
            even though it may cost him his life. Secondly this common
            appearance and uniform ensures easy recognition One can easily spot
            a Khalsa in a crowd. Each symbol has its own use and psychological
            significance.
          </p>
          <p>The significance of Symbols-Panj Kakar- is given below :</p>
          <p>
            Underwear Kachha) ensures agility and briskness. It is a mark of
            perpetual readiness. It also stands for chastity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrist-band Kara is a sign of restraint and bondage. It indicates
            that one is a devotee of the Guru. A look at the wrist-band will
            bring shame to a Sikh when he does any misdeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword (Kirpan) is an emblem of power and courage. It is to be used
            primarily as an instrument of defence.

            Unshorn Hair Kes) is an emblem of the saints and Rishis of the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comb Kanga is necessary to keep the hair clean and in shape. The
            hair make a Khalsa look exactly like Guru Gobind Singh Sahib and
            enable him to behave exactly like the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh Sahib
            says, “The Khalsa is my special form ;I live in the embodiment of
            the Khalsa. The Khalsa is a part and parcel of my body ; the Khalsa
            is my very soul.”
