            <p>
              Very many people question the need of Kirpan or the sword in the
              atomic age. Others require an explanation for the wearing of the
              sword. How can sword he reconciled with spirituality ? Even before
              Guru Gobind Singh Sahib, his grandfather Guru Hargobind had donned
              the sword as a twin-symbol of temporal and spiritual power (Miri &
              Piri). He had maintained an army and taken part in military
              operations against the Mughal forces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guru Gobind Singh Sahib justified the use of the sword as a duty
              and as a means of protecting the weak and the oppressed. With
              human brutes, non-violence is meaningless. Guru Gobind Singh Sahib
              says:
            </p>
            <p>
              When the affairs are past other remedies, It is justifiable to
              unsheath the sword.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tyrants are like mad dogs and wolves. They should be opposed in
              the interests of the good of humanity as a whole. The sword is
              neither to be used for conquest nor for wreaking vengeance. The
              sword is meant only for self-defence or for the good of the
              people. In cases of injustice and intolerance, the refusal to use
              the sword may do more harm than good. The Sikhâ€™s sword is not an
              instrument of offence but a symbol of independence, self-respect
              and power. Guru Gobind Singh Sahib called it Durga or Bhagwati and
              praises it thus :
            </p>

            <p>Sword that smites in a flash,</p>
            <p>That scatters the armies of the wicked</p>
            <p>In the great battle-field,</p>
            <p>0 symbol of the brave.</p>
            <p>Your arm is irresistible, your brightness shines forth</p>
            <p>The splendour of the black dazzles like the sun.</p>
            <p>Sword, you are the scourge of saints,</p>
            <p>You are the scourge of the wicked ;</p>
            <p>Scatterer of sinners, I take refuge with you.</p>
            <p>Hail to the Creator. Saviour and sustainer,</p>
            <p>Hail to you : Sword supreme !</p>
