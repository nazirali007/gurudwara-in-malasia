            <b>GURPURBS</b>

            <p>
              Gurpurbs are part and parcel of Sikhism. In history we see that
              the Sikhs have to sacrifice even their lives in order to celebrate
              the Gurpurbs. Whether it is DEWALI (Bandi Chhor Diwas), VAISAKHI
              (Khalsa Sajna Diwas), or Martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Sahib (Sahidi
              Diwas), Sikhs gather and remember their Gurus & pay homage to the
              great Martyrs. All the Gurpurbs are celebrated with great fervor &
              enthusiasm by the Sikhs throughout the world. We are giving the
              account of the main & widely celebrated Gurpurbs.

            <p>
              The birthday celebrations & Gurpurabs of Guru Sahibs usually last
              for three days. Generally before the birthday-date Akhand Path is
              held in the Gurdwara. A large procession (Nagar Kirtan) is
              organised one day before the birthday. This is led by the Panj
              Piyaras (Five beloved ones) and the Palki (Palanquin) of Shri Guru
              Granth Sahib and followed by groups of kirtani Jatha, Various
              School bands and students, eminent Citizens, Gatka Parties
              (displaying mock-battle with the traditional weapons), and
              devotees singing hymns from Guru Granth Sahib in chorus. The
              passage of the nagar kirtan is decorated with flags, flowers,
              religious posters decorated gates and banners depicting various
              aspects of Sikhism. On the Gurpurab day, the Divan begins early in
              morning at about 4 or 5 a.m. with the singing of Asa-di-var and
              hymns from Guru Granth Sahib. Sometimes it is followed by katha
              (discourse), religious and Sikh Historical lectures and recitation
              of poems in praise of the Guru. Kirtan-Darbars and Amrit Sanchar
              ceremonies are also held in the Gurdwara hall. After Ardas and
              distribution of Karah Parshad (sweet pudding) the Langar (food) is
              served to one and all and there is kirtan till late in the night,
              the distribution of langar continues to the end of the programme.
