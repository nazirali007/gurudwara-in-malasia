              The word ‘Sikh’ means a disciple. So Sikhism is essentially the
              path of discipleship. The true sikh remains unattached to worldly
              things just as the lotus keeps its blossom over and above the
              surface of water. The Sikh must do his duty to his family and to
              the community. The main thing is leading a pure and moral life,
              full of noble deeds and kind words. A Sikh does not regard
              fasting, austerities, pilgrimages, alm s-giving and penance as
              important things.

              <span className="fw-bolder">Bhagti: </span> Those who know the
              importance of Bhagti feel like Guru Nanak Sahib that forgetting
              God is just like death and brooding upon His Name is life and joy.
              Without the nectar of God’s name, the pilgrim dies his misery. But
              Bhagti is possible after certain conditions are fulfilled:
            </p>

            <p>Faith in God. </p>
            <p>Following Truth. </p>
            <p>Unattachment and desirelessness. </p>
            <p>Control over thought, word and deed. </p>
            <p>Association with holy men(Satsang)</p>
            <p>Humanity and submission to Hukam.</p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Salvation/Mukti: </span>
              The Guru says, “The man of God rejects salvation. He wants only
              love of God and nothing else. The joys of heaven are nothing as
              compared to the merging in the Divine Spirit. The ultimate goal of
              man is union with God. Man does not become God, only the spark
              merges in the fire. This is called self- identification.” A man
              may have done many noble deeds but if he has not undertaken
              meditation on God, he cannot have any hope of Mukti. Guru Nanak
              Sahib says in Asa- di-Var: “That is true knowledge when the truth
              is in the heart, when the dirt of falsehood vanishes and life is
              pure and clean. That is true living when one fixes one’s love on
              truth and finds joy in the hearing of the Name.”
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder"> Need of Guru: </span>: Almost all the
              great religions of the world emphasis the need of a preceptor or
              Guru or holy man for the attainment of salvation. The Vedas
              enumerate the qualities of a religious guide. Even Guru Nanak
              Sahib emphasizes that bliss can be obtained only through the grace
              of the Guru. Sikhism does not recognize either chosen prophets or
              chosen people. Guru Nanak Sahib did not insist on a physical Guru
              (Dehdari. His own Guru was God Himself. What is important is not
              the person but the word-“The word is the Guru. The Guru is the
              word. If the devotee follows what the word says, surely the Guru
              will save him.” That is why Guru Gobind Singh Sahib installed Sri
              Granth Sahib as Guru for all time. We do not need any man as Guru
              because the word is now with us. Guru Arjan Sahib says, “Without a
              Guru, liberation cannot be won. The Guru is my boat, which will
              ferry me across the rough ocean of existence.” The Guru destroys
              illusions and attachment to worldly objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guru Ramdas Sahib says, “The Guru is the Sikh and the Sikh who
              practices the Guru’s word is equal to the Guru.” Guru Gobind Singh
              Sahib says, “I live and have my being in the Khalsa.” The Guru
              lives in the form of the Panth. He resides in the Sangat. All the
              Gurus are identical with Nanak. Guru Gobind Singh Sahib passed on
              the corporal succession to the Panth, which is regarded as the
              embodiment of the Guru. The Panth represents the Guru and it is
              progressing, With the passage of time, the Panth is evolving. It
              is a dynamic and corporate personality with authority to make
              decisions (Gurmatas) binding on the Sikhs. In this way, there is a
              two-fold concept of Guru-dom, one permanent, the other
              progressive. The Word is the embodiment of eternal and changless
              truth, while the Panth is the progressive, collective personality
              of the Guru in Sikhs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guru Granth Sahib is the living embodiment of the Ten Gurus. It is
              the living flame of the Name, which lights the lamp of the
              disciple. There is no place for a living Guru in the Sikh
              religion, because Gurbani is Guru and Guru is Gurbani. After all,
              what the Guru does is to guide the disciple by means of words, in
              the same way Guru Granth Sahib guides the Sikh through its
              song-message. When a Sikh is in doubt about any principle of
              Sikhism, he refers the matter to the Panth for decision.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Reading of Scriptures: </span>
              Many good thoughts and noble sayings are found in sacred books but
              mere reading cannot help much. It is only the first step. Guru
              Nanak Sahib says :”If a man reads books throughout his whole life,
              till breath leaves his body, only the Holy Name is valuable, all
              else is vanity of the self.” Again, “the scholar is an idiot if he
              has greed, avarice and pride.” What is important is the practice
              of the Name and the cultivation of virtue. An ounce of practice is
              preferable to a ton of knowledge. Ethics and laws tell us what to
              believe and what to do ; they are like signposts. But one has to
              do the walking oneself. One can-not reach God by books or by
              rituals. Scriptures are our guides for action. They cannot fill
              the disciple with divine love. The knowledge of Vedas does not
              bring liberation: “God is beyond the Vedas, beyond the holy
              books.” He can be found within the self by digging inward.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">The doctrine of Grace: </span>
              Guru Nanak Sahib tells us that God has chosen him as a bride out
              of a large number. This is the reward for the qualities of the
              bride- humility, loyalty, sweet words-which have won for her the
              grace of the Lord. Surrender to God is the highest virtue of
              freedom. Just as a faithful wife gets the utmost pleasure in her
              complete surrender to her good husband, in the same way, the
              devotee gets supreme bliss by surrendering himself to God.
              Self-surrender to God means the absence of earthly cravings and
              desires.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Grace and Karma: </span>: The
              modification of Karma by grace is an essential principle of
              Sikhism. Guru Nanak Sahib says:
            </p>

            <pre>
              Karma is the cause of birth in this world, But salvation can be
              obtained by His Grace.
            </pre>
            <p>
              Good actions win not only public approbation but also divine
              favor.God does not interfere with man’s choice, though as the
              Ruler of the universe, he controls the over-all destiny of
              individuals.
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder"> Caste and Sikhism: </span>: Sikhism
              does not inculcate belief in caste. No man is born great or low.
              Guru Amardas says, “All colours and forms are thine.” Guru Arjan
              Sahib gives the simile of the potter. The clay has been molded in
              different forms. All men are the vessels of God. People may follow
              different faiths or divide themselves under different labels, but
              essentially man is one and indivisible. Whoever meditates on God
              becomes as great as He. Look at Ravidas the cobbler, Sadhna the
              butcher, Saina the barber. They were raised to the pedestal of
              saintliness and honored by all. Just as the philosopher’s stone
              transmutes iron ore into gold, in the same way God’s name changes
              a low-born person into a Bhagat. God’s name cleanses and purifies.
              It burns away all impurity. A person of high caste is worse than
              one of the lowest caste if he does not meditate on the Name.
              Moreover, caste is of no consequence in the next world. In God’s
              Court, men shall be judged by their thoughts and deeds, and not by
              their family or pedigree. The Guru brought the four castes under
              one banner. And yet he taught us to be humble and poor in spirit,
              because with-out it, we cannot sublimate egoism(haumai).
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Place of miracles: </span>
              Saints and prophets should not perform miracles to confirm the
              faith of people in them. Miracles should not be worked to prove
              the greatness or truth of a religion. In fact, it is a hindrance
              in the spiritual path. Guru Amardas says, “The desire to perform
              miracles is a worldly attachment and is an obstacle in the way of
              the Name residing in our hearts.” Guru Nanak Sahib had no taste
              for miracle. The greatest miracle was not to perform a miracle, in
              spite of his capacity to do so. He said:
            </p>
            <p>If I exercise supernatural powers </p>
            <p>And can create wealth at pleasure, </p>
            <p>Can appear and disappear at will, </p>
            <p>And thus win popular respect, </p>
            <p>These delude fools only, </p>
            <p>Who have no God in their hearts.</p>
            <p>
              When the Sidhs asked Guru Nanak Sahib to show them a miracle, he
              replied that he would not do so : “Except the True Name, I have no
              miracle.” Guru Arjan Sahib and Guru Teg Bahadur underwent tortures
              but refused to perform miracles. Men of God do not like to engage
              in such tricks. Guru Hargobind rebuked his son Baba Atal for
              exhibiting supernatural powers for which the latter had to pay
              with his own life.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Renunciation of the world: </span>:
              Leaving one’s home and family and living away from people is not
              favored in Sikhism. Guru Nanak Sahib remonstrated the Yogis and
              the. Sidhs who lived in lonely and deserted places. The mind does
              not get peace in physical solitude. He writes in Sidh-Gosht:
            </p>
            <p>Even when one is far away from cities, </p>
            <p>The mind wanders away in sleep;</p>
            <p>Live by all means in society, </p>
            <p>But covet not another man’s wife, </p>
            <p>Through His Name, one gets self-control. </p>
            <p>
              The Gurus regarded married life Grahst as the best mode of life.
              Escapism from the realities of life is not saintliness. The
              household is a school where self- love is transformed into service
              of others and where the need to make an honest living leads to
              elevation of character.Guru Arjan Sahib says :
            </p>

            <p>Renunciation of lust, anger, attachment is praiseworthy</p>
            <p>
              Guru Gobind Singh Sahib described renunciation thus : “0 my soul,
              practice renunciation in this way; consider your house as a forest
              and yourself as an ascetic in it. Let continence be your matted
              hair and communion with God your ablutions; instead of growing
              long nails pray daily; exert for acquiring divine knowledge ;
              instead of rubbing ashes on the body repeat His Name.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Guru Nanak Sahib says, “He who fixes the mind on God’s feet, who
              remains desire- less amid desires and is in love with the True
              One, is a real Sanyasi” Such a man is neither depressed by sorrow
              and misfortune nor elated by joy. He accepts happiness and sorrow
              with the same spirit.”
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Pilgrimage: </span>: According to Sikh
              religion, pilgrimage confers no spiritual benefit. Guru Nanak
              Sahib says, “Pilgrimage does not have the value of even a mustard
              seed. At places of pilgrimage people take bath in holy rivers or
              tanks. But outward washing does not cleanse the mind. Guru Nanak
              Sahib says :
            </p>

            <p>Why wash the body from outside ? </p>
            <p>Wash the mind, </p>
            <p>Clean it of the dirt of desire, ‘ </p>
            <p>And tread the path of salvation </p>
            <p>
              All Gurus have tried to remove the wrong notion of the efficacy of
              pilgrimage. Guru Nanak Sahib says, “I would like to go to
              pilgrimage only if it pleased Him.” Again he says, “My places of
              pilgrimage are the Word, contemplation and divine knowledge within
              me.”
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Fasting: </span>
              Sikhism does not regard tasting as an act of religious merit.
              Fasting, in order to overcome disease or abnormality, is perfectly
              Iconistic. But fasting for austerity and ritual is hateful. Guru
              Nanak Sahib says, “Penance, fasting, austerity, alms-giving are
              inferior to truth; right action is superior to them all ” To
              affirm that spirituality depends on the quality or quantity of
              food is absurd. One must take normal food. If a man cannot take
              it, there is something wrong with him. But to fast for the sake of
              fasting is futile.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="fw-bolder">Maya: </span>
              Maya has been defined in various ways. According to some, this
              world is Maya an illusion. According to Sikhism, the universe
              being the creation of the Supreme Being, is the temple of
              Divinity. It is as embodiment of His Eternal Truth. The world is
              subject to the Divine Will ; it has no independent existence of
              its own. In that sense, it is unreal or illusory; it is subject to
              decay : ”The universe is insubstantial as a shadow, fleeting like
              a dream, short-lived as a bubble,” as compared with the Creator,
              the Eternal Truth, The Guru writes :
            </p>
            <p>In a thousand waterpots </p>
            <p>There is one sky reflected, </p>
            <p>When the water-pots burst, </p>
            <p>The sky remains as before. </p>
            <p>
              Man is caught with the infatuation of desire. This lure of
              worldliness makes him regard worldly things as [he goat of human
              life.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              The concept of education in Sikhism: Sikhism includes a
              comprehensive system of self-education. The function of education
              is to prepare the aesthetic and emotional back-ground in which the
              individual may pet an opportunity for self-growth. Besides this,
              Dharma must inspire all the instruction and atmosphere in
              educational institutions.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the knowledge of the Hand. the knowledge of the Head and the
              knowledge of the Heart. The education of the Hand means the
              realization of the dignity of labour and the readiness of the
              individual to earn his living with manual work. It also includes
              the service of humanity with the hand. Guru Nanak Sahib says :{" "}
            </p>
            <p>Those who earn their living </p>
            <p>By the sweat of their brows, </p>
            <p>And give it to the needy </p>
            <p>Are the people who know, </p>
            <p>The path of Truth and Virtue. </p>
            <p>
              Education does not imply the acquisition of powers to rule over
              others or to exploit their simplicity or backwardness for selfish
              ends.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>Make knowledge your merchandise, </p>
            <p>Truth the horses you take to sell, </p>
            <p>Tie up virtues as your traveling expenses, </p>
            <p>Think not in your heart of the morrow, </p>
            <p>When you reach the land of your love, </p>
            <p>You shall obtain endless joy. </p>
            <p>
              Guru Nanak Sahib gave a practical demonstration of this system of
              education by training his successor Sri Guru Angad Sahib. It was
              the training of the disciple through discipline. Man is to merge
              with the higher self, with Beauty. Truth and Goodness. This makes
              education both creative and purposeful.

              <span className="fw-bolder">Union with God: </span>: The feeling
              of unity of the individual with the Universal on the psychic plane
              is called “liv”. The man of God does not renounce the world. He
              lives in it and performs all his duties as a householder. But he
              does not feel attached to worldly desire. The apparent attachment
              of the mind with the world is lost; the mind remains in constant
              communion with Divinity. Such a man meditates or does good
              naturally and automatically. In tune with the infinite, the
              individual soul feels no pain or sorrow.

              <span className="fw-bolder">Union of Soul With God: </span>
              Guru Arjan Sahib has mentioned five aspects of the actual
              experience of the union of the individual soul with the Universal
              Soul. Firstly, the darkness of ignorance disappears and the
              individual realizes the wonder of God’s universe. Secondly, there
              is an inner illumination, a kind of revelation – an enlightenment,
              not of the intellect but of mystic exaltation. Thirdly, the
              individual gains equipoise, a state of indefinable peace and
              confidence, coming from the loss of the ego. This sense of
              tranquility/shanti is due to the identification of the self with
              Divinity. Fourthly, the individual begins to love the entire
              humanity and is filled with a great longing for the service of his
              fellow-men. Fifthly, the individual realizes everything as
              emanating from God. His soul which had emanated from God is united
              with the Ultimate Source.

              <span className="fw-bolder">The True Yogi: </span>A true yogi is
              not one who leaves his family and home, and wanders all over the
              country. A true yogi finds renunciation in the house itself. He
              does not regard llie house as his own but of the Lord, He
              renounces egoism. The true yogi is a friend of all : he is a
              servant of servants. He fixes his mind on God and remains desire
              less in the world.'” He remains indifferent to sorrow and
              happiness. He is free from cares, because he loves the only one
              God.

              Guru Nanak Sahib rebuked the yogis for going to the houses of
              laity for begging. He denounced parasitism and recommended
              renunciation of desire and attachment in the midst of temporal
              life through the discipline of the Name.{" "}

              <span className="fw-bolder">The Concept of Woman: </span>
              The Gurus held woman in high esteem. So with the rise of Sikhism,
              woman gained in dignity and social position. Some ancient
              scriptures denounced woman as unworthy of teaching or religious
              exercises. Woman was regarded as evil and unclean. Guru Nanak
              Sahib challenged this view: Why should we treat woman with
              contempt and cruelty? A woman is not to be condemned on the ground
              of her sex. Guru Granth Sahib says:
            </p>
            <p>Of a woman we are conceived, </p>
            <p>Of a woman we are born, </p>
            <p>To a woman we are betrothed and married, </p>
            <p>It is a woman who is a friend and partner of life, </p>
            <p>It is a woman who keeps the race going, </p>
            <p>Why should we consider women cursed and condemned, </p>
            <p>When from woman are born leaders and rulers.</p>
            <p>(Rag Asa, I) </p>
            <p>
              Religious gatherings and Kirtan were thrown open to women; they
              could participate on equal terms with men in temporal and secular
              observances. Bhai Gurdas ji, the veteran Sikh theologian affirmed:
              ” Woman is man’s other half, and as such, helps him in attaining
              to salvation.” Guru Hargobind Sahib called woman ” the conscience
              of man.” Khande di Pahul(Amrit) is obligatory both for man and
              woman. The rules of conduct and the sphere of religious duties are
              identical both for man and woman. In religious meetings, men and
              women sing and lecture like equals. Guru Amardas Sahib condemned
              the practice of widow-burning (Sati): He said, “They are not satis
              who burn themselves with the dead bodies of their husbands. Those
              are real Satis who die of the mere shock of separation from their
              husbands.” Thus the equality of sexes is emphasized in Sikhism.
